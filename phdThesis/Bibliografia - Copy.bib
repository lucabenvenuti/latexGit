	abstract={Particulate systems are of interest in many disciplines. They are often investigated using the discrete element method because of its capability to investigate particulate systems at the individual particle scale. To model the interaction between two particles and between a particle and a boundary, conventional discrete element models use springs and dampers in both the normal and tangential directions. The significance of particle rotation has been highlighted in both numerical studies and physical experiments. Several researchers have attempted to incorporate a rotational torque to account for the rolling resistance or rolling friction by developing different models. This paper presents a review of the commonly used models for rolling resistance and proposes a more general model. These models are classified into four categories according to their key characteristics. The robustness of these models in reproducing rolling resistance effects arising from different physical situations was assessed by using several benchmarking test cases. The proposed model can be seen to be more general and suitable for modelling problems involving both dynamic and pseudo-static regimes. An example simulation of the formation of a 2D sandpile is also shown. For simplicity, all formulations and examples are presented in 2D form, though the general conclusions are also applicable to 3D systems.},

	abstract={Abstract Studying the flow of granular materials is important for its impact on both industrial applications and natural phenomena. A fundamental understanding of the flow of granular materials is lacking, and this results in difficulties in modeling and predicting their flow behavior. The discrete element method (DEM) is often used as the â€œgold standardâ€ both for predicting the results of experiments as well as for comparison to continuum-level theories of granular material flows due to its derivation from first-principal constructs, like contact mechanics. In this paper, we continue our work on quantitative validation of DEM simulations using detailed measurements of simple, well-characterized flows that allow us to examine the effect of rough surfaces and rotational rates on granular flow using an annular shear cell. Experimentally, we use digital particle tracking velocimetry (DPTV) to obtain velocity, solids fraction, and granular temperature profiles. Computationally, we compare the results obtained using different contact mechanics force laws to those from experimental measurements as well as perform a sensitivity analysis on device and particle geometry and different material properties employed. In previous work on stainless steel beads, we have found that an elasto-plastic normal force model is critical to obtaining accurate results as is detailed matching of both particle and system geometry, while the choice of friction model is found to be unimportant. Here, we examine the robustness of these observations to both particle materials properties as well as systemic variables (such as total system solids fraction). We find that the choice of frictional force model has little effect across all the profiles and all models, while the accuracy of the normal force model is material-dependent.},

	journal={Powder Technology},
	volume={232},
	number={0},
	pages={7-17},
	abstract={Powder die fill (PDF) process prior to compaction affects spatial density of the final part and its in-service performance. Inhomogeneous density leads to part distortion (or warpage) during sintering, resulting in inability to get the desired dimensional tolerances and mechanical properties in the final product. Therefore, to improve quality of the final part, it is important to eliminate several causes of non-uniformity during the powder die filling stage. This experimental study relates to some new approaches toward characterization of PDF process, using an experimental apparatus with transparent shoe and die sections. In this paper, the influence of a newly designed perforated plate (PP), incorporated at the bottom of the feed shoe on PDF is studied. The effect of PP on powder redistribution in the feed shoe, powder transfer and resulting powder spatial density uniformity, and porosity within a thin ring-shaped die is compared with the powder flow and segregation behavior in standard shoe (SS) filling. Various colored salt powder experiments using arrangements in layers and columns within the feed shoe as well as a commercial iron power are considered in an attempt to analyze the subsequent powder redistribution within the shoe, during shoe motion and final powder packing in the die. It is determined that the colored salt is a promising medium for simulating the flow characteristics and segregation of commercial iron powder macroscopically. Further, critical shoe speed for powder delivery into the die-cavity using a perforated plate and a standard shoe are studied. Continuous imaging of the transparent shoe and die wall sections with an on-line high speed CCD camera are also used to record powder flow and to obtain resulting porosity from quantitative pixel-based analysis of the post-fill final images. The effectiveness and limitations of the perforated plate in achieving a more homogenous powder fill and reduced porosity in the die is explained with the help of both colored powder experiments and the surface porosity data from the transparent die face section. Finally, a successful attempt is made to bind the loose iron powder using a polymer resin blend into the shape of a ring within the die. This ring shaped component is then analyzed for its spatial porosity distribution, and thereby its spatial density distribution, using gamma ray densitometry.},

	volume={257},

	pages={11-19},
	abstract={Abstract An accurate correlation for the smooth sphere drag coefficient with wide range of applicability is a useful tool in the field of particle technology. The present study focuses on the development of high accurate drag coefficient correlations from low to very high Reynolds numbers (up to 106) using a multi-gene Genetic Programming (GP) procedure. A clear superiority of GP over other methods is that GP is able to determine the structure and parameters of the model, simultaneously, while the structure of the model is imposed by the user in traditional regression analysis, and only the parameters of the model are assigned. In other words, in addition to the parameters of the model, the structure of it can be optimized using GP approach. Among two new and high accurate models of the present study, one of them is acceptable for the region before drag dip, and the other is applicable for the whole range of Reynolds numbers up to 106 including the transient region from laminar to turbulent. The performances of the developed models are examined and compared with other reported models. The results indicate that these models respectively give 16.2 \% and 69.4 \% better results than the best existing correlations in terms of the sum of squared of logarithmic deviations (SSLD). On the other hand, the proposed models are validated with experimental data. The validation results show that all of the estimated drag coefficients are within the bounds of +- 7 \% of experimental values.},

	pages={84-93},
	abstract={Abstract The appropriate choice of contact parameters is of great importance, particularly when simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) are run with the aim of capturing quantitative information on collision events that occur among the individual particles, as what happens during handling of iron ore pellets. The paper analyzes the use of tests conducted with single pellets for estimating material and contact parameters that are required in DEM simulations using the no-slip Hertz-Mindlin model. Tests included impact load cell, tribometer, drop tests and a simple test in which the rolling angle of individual pellets is measured. It is concluded that, provided particle shapes are described appropriately, DEM simulations provide reasonably realistic predictions of pellet motion in assemblies from contact parameters measured on the basis of single-particle tests. In this case the physical significance of the contact parameters is maintained. However, if pellets are described in a simplistic way as spheres, then the DEM simulation of their flow no longer matches the experimental results, requiring fitting some of the contact parameters in order to match the observed global flow, so that much of the physical meaning of the parameters is lost.},

	abstract={Abstract Mathematical models of pneumatic conveying in dilute mode of flow have been presented by many researchers. Continuum approach is the most commonly used approach of modeling this kind of flow. In the present work a mathematical model has been developed which is in the form of governing equations such as continuity, momentum and energy equation. Energy equation has been written including a parameter called granular temperature. In this model, the dilute mode of conveying has been described as chaotically moving particles as granular gas characterized by granular temperature. Simulations have been performed in order to predict different parameters. The predicted pressure drop values were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. Variations of important parameters such as absolute pressure, granular temperature along the length of the pipeline have been analyzed for different values of normal and restitution coefficients.},

	pages={126-139},
	abstract={Abstract Handling of granular materials involves the use of many solids processing devices such as chutes, hoppers, tumblers or other transfer equipment. Unfortunately, granular materials segregate if they are subjected to flow or external agitation in the presence of a gravitational field. Thus, operation of many of these devices is prone to segregation. Many studies of granular flow have focused on gravity driven chute flows owing to their practical importance in granular processing and to the fact that the relative simplicity of this type of flow allows for development and testing of new theories/equipment. In the present work, we observe the deposition behavior of both mono-sized and polydisperse dry granular materials in an inclined chute flow, both experimentally and computationally. We investigate the effects on the mass fraction distribution of granular materials of different parameters such as chute angle, particle size, falling height and charge amount. The simulation results obtained using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are compared with the experimental findings and a high degree of agreement is observed. Tuning of the underlying contact force parameters allows realistic results and is used as a means of validating the simulation model against available experimental data. The tuned simulation is then used to test predictions of granular segregation theories outlined in previous studies. That is, it has been predicted that a system can maintain a mixed configuration when L<Uavgts, where L, Uavg, and ts denote the length of the chute, the average stream-wise flow velocity of the particles, and the characteristic time of segregation, respectively. Our results with the tuned simulation support these conclusions for chute flows.},

	abstract={Abstract Truncated spherical harmonic expansions are used to approximate the shape of 3D star-shaped particles including a wide range of axially symmetric ellipsoids, cuboids, and over 40.000 real particles drawn from seven different material sources. This mathematical procedure enables any geometric property to be calculated for these star-shaped particles. Calculations are made of properties such as volume, surface area, triaxial dimensions, the maximum inscribed sphere, and the minimum enclosing sphere, as well as differential geometric properties such as surface normals and principal curvatures, and the values are compared to the analytical values for well-characterized geometric shapes. We find that a particle's Krumbein triaxial dimensions, widely used in the sedimentary geology literature, are essentially identical numerically to the length, width, and thickness dimensions that are used to characterize gravel shape in the construction aggregate industry. Of these dimensions, we prove that the length is a lower bound on a particle's minimum enclosing sphere diameter and that the thickness is an upper bound on its maximum inscribed sphere diameter. We examine the â€œtrue sphericityâ€ and the shape entropy, and we also introduce a new sphericity factor based on the radius ratio of the maximum inscribed sphere to the minimum enclosing sphere. This bounding sphere ratio, which can be calculated numerically or approximated from macroscopic dimensions, has the advantage that it is less sensitive to surface roughness than the true sphericity. For roundness, we extend Wadell's classical 2D definition for particle silhouettes to 3D shapes and we also introduce a new roundness factor based on integrating the dot product of the surface position unit vector and the unit normal vector. Limited evidence suggests that the latter roundness factor more faithfully captures the common notion of roundness based on visual perception of particle shapes, and it is significantly simpler to calculate than the classical roundness factor.},

	abstract={A novel particle tracking velocimetry (PTV)/computational fluid dynamics (CFD) hybrid method for measuring coefficient of restitution (COR) has been developed which is relatively simple, cost-effective, and robust. A laser and camera system is used in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig to measure velocity trajectories of microparticles. The method solves for particle impact velocity at the impact surface using a CFD solution and Lagrangian particle tracking. The methodology presented here attempts to characterize a difficult problem by a combination of established techniques, PTV and CFD, which have not been used in this capacity before. Erosion and deposition are functions of particle/wall interactions and COR is a fundamental property of these interactions. COR depends on impact velocity, angle of impact, temperature, particle composition, and wall material. Two sizes of Arizona road dust and one size of glass beads are impacted on to a 304 stainless steel coupon. Mean results collected using this new technique compare favorably with trends established in literature. The utilization of this technique to measure COR of microparticle sand will help develop a computational model and serve as a baseline for further measurements at elevated air and wall temperatures.},

These detailed comparisons reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the various models for simulating mills and allow the effect of different modelling assumptions to be quantitatively evaluated. In particular, very close agreement is demonstrated between the full 3D model (including the end wall effects) and the experiments. It is also demonstrated that the traditional two-dimensional circular particle DEM model under-predicts the shoulder, toe and vortex center positions and the power draw by around 10 degrees. The effect of particle shape and the dimensionality of the model are also assessed, with particle shape predominantly affecting the shoulder position while the dimensionality of the model affects mainly the toe position.},

	pages={89-111},
	abstract={While the discrete element method (DEM) is attracting increasing interest for the simulation of industrial granular flow, much of the previous DEM modelling has considered two-dimensional (2D) flows and used circular particles. The inclusion of particle shape into DEM models is very important and allows many flow features, particularly in hoppers, to be more accurately reproduced than was possible when using only circular particles. Elongated particles are shown here to produce flow rates up to 30% lower than for circular particles and give flow patterns that are quite different. The yielding of the particle microstructure resembles more the tearing of a continuum solid, with large-scale quasi-stable voids being formed and large groups of particles moving together. The flow becomes increasingly concentrated in a relatively narrow funnel above the hopper opening. This encourages the hope that DEM may be able to predict important problems such as bridging and rat-holing. Increasing the blockiness or angularity of the particles is also shown to increase resistance to flow and reduces the flow rates by up to 28%, but without having perceptible effect on the nature of the flow. We also describe our methodology for constructing and modelling geometrically complex industrial applications in three dimensions and present a series of industrially important three-dimensional (3D) case studies. The charge motion in a 5 m diameter ball mill and in a Hicom nutating mill, discharge from single- and four-port cylindrical hoppers, and particle size separation by a vibrating screen are demonstrated. For each case, plausible particle size distributions (PSDs) have been used. The results obtained indicate that DEM modelling is now sufficiently advanced that it can make useful contributions to process optimisation and equipment design. Finally the parallelisation of such a DEM code is described and benchmark performance results for a large-scale 2D hopper flow are presented.},

	abstract={Abstract The increased necessity to obtain energy from other sources than conventional fossil fuels has led to the growing interest in solar energy. The problem with the proposed technology is that it can only provide power during the day and therefore requires some sort of storage system, if power is to be supplied throughout the day and night. A number of storage systems exist, but the one of particular interest is packed rock beds. Discrete Element Models (DEM) of rock beds were developed through both experimental and numerical procedures, by conducting a series of sensitivity and calibration studies. Through these procedures, a set of microproperties could be determined to accurately model the rock particles. The properties were verified by modelling the discharge from a hopper with three different opening widths. Further, the research focused on the potential of constructing self-supporting tunnels within the rock beds in order to improve the air flow through the bed by minimizing the pressure drop. Horizontal and vertical tunnels were investigated, each with different diameters. It was observed that if the appropriate steps were followed, stable self-supporting tunnels could be formed using particles of different scale.},

Methods The relative de-agglomeration of three lactoses of different particle size distributions (Lactohale 201 or LH201, Lactohale 210 or LH210 and Lactohale 220 or LH220) was determined from laser diffraction particle sizing of the aerosol plume at different air flow rates. The agglomerate strength distributions were estimated by Monte Carlo simulation using the primary particle size, work of cohesion and tapped density distributions determined by laser diffraction, inverse gas chromatography and tapping apparatus, respectively. The morphology and particle shape parameters were determined by scanning electron microscopy and the Morphologi G3. Results The estimated agglomerate strength correlated well with the de-agglomeration of all lactose samples at different air flow rates. While the work of cohesion of the lactose samples was not significantly different, the packing fraction was dependent on the proportion and shape of intermediate-sized, cohesive particles between 5.4 and 14micron. For example, while the proportion of particles . Conclusion The study reinforced the role of agglomerate strength distributions in understanding de-agglomeration of cohesive materials.

	pages={104-116},
	abstract={This paper presents segregation of powder mixtures in silos of different scale on the basis of recent experimental findings with binary and ternary mixtures as well as commercial construction materials. Dimensional analysis is performed to reduce the number of variables and to bring forth dimensionless groups. Based on these experimental correlations (models) are proposed for describing the concentration of fine particles at the walls as a result of silo filling and segregation towards the end of complete discharge. Parameters of both models are fitted to experimental data using the method of least sum of squares. The filling model shows good agreement with experimental data and the description of segregation at discharge is in general agreement with experimental findings. Important variables for the distribution of particles at silo filling include the mass fraction of fines, particle size ratio (coarse/fine), particle solid density ratio (coarse/fine), free fall distance, silo diameter and inlet diameter. On the basis of the proposed model for silo filling, the concentration of fine particles at the silo walls increases with increasing fines content, size ratio and density ratio for the powder mixture, as well as the ratio for free fall distance and silo diameter and the ratio for silo diameter and inlet diameter. This result is in general agreement with the findings of other investigators, but the observation that segregation at silo discharge is, to a large extent, determined by the material distribution at filling is new and interesting. This confirms the qualitative conclusions of earlier work by the authors and shows that mass flow designs do not always entirely correct for side-to-side segregation patterns (induced during filling) at silo discharge. The findings of this paper should be of considerable interest to producers of construction materials and to other industries where segregation of powder mixtures in silos is a major concern.},

	volume={262},
	number={0},
	pages={62-70},
	abstract={Abstract We have developed a direct numerical simulation approach combined with the immersed boundary (DNS-IB) method for studying heat transfer in particulate flows. In this method, fluid velocity and temperature fields are obtained by solving the modified momentum and heat transfer equations, which are due to the presence of heated particles in the fluid; particles are tracked individually and their velocities and positions are solved based on the equations of linear and angular motions; particle temperature is assumed to be constant. The momentum and heat exchanges between a particle and the surrounding fluid at its surface are resolved using the immersed boundary method with the direct forcing scheme. The DNS-IB method has been used to study the heat transfer of 225 heated spheres in a fluidized bed. By exploring the rich data generated from the DNS-IB simulations, we are able to obtain statistically averaged fluid and particle velocities as well as the overall heat transfer rate in the fluidized bed. Good agreement between the current study and the one by Pan et al. (2002) is found for the hydrodynamic properties of the bed such as pressure gradients within the bed and the relationship between fluidization velocity and bed solid fraction. The particle-averaged Nusselt number is found to increase as the fluidization velocity increases and the bed height rises; particles at the entrance of the bed tend to have the maximum heat transfer rate because of the higher particle-fluid temperature gradients in this region; as the fluid moves upward in the bed, it gets warmer, which reduces particle-fluid temperature gradients and decreases the transfer rate of particles.},

	pages={425-435},
	abstract={Much research regarding handling and storage characteristics of bulk solids has been conducted over the years. Physical properties of granular solids play a significant role in their resulting storage and flow behaviour, and are therefore essential to design appropriate, efficient, and economic bulk solids handling and storage equipment and structures. Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS) is a bulk material that has been widely used as a protein source for ruminants and non-ruminants for more than two decades. Distillers grains are energy and nutrient dense, and are often used as a replacement for corn in animal diets. With the exponential growth of the fuel ethanol industry in the last few years, large quantities of distiller's grains are now being produced. To effectively utilize these feeds in domestic and international markets, however, these co-product streams are increasingly being transported greater distances, and must be stored until final use. DDGS flow is problematic as it often becomes restricted by caking and bridging which occurs during transportation and storage. This issue probably results from a number of factors, including storage moisture, temperature, relative humidity, particle size, time, or temperature variations, to name a few. The objective of this study was to review the primary factors affecting flowability, handling, and storage of granular solids and powders, as well as appropriate testing methodologies for these materials. Considering these will be helpful when examining granular flowability and storage challenges for byproduct feeds, including those surrounding the use of DDGS.},

	abstract={Abstract New robust Lagrangian computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models are powerful tools that can be used to study the behavior of a diverse population of coal particle sizes, densities, and mineral compositions in entrained gasifiers. By using this approach, the responses of the particles impacting the wall were characterized over a range of velocities (1 to 8m/s) and incident angles (90 to 20). Within CFD models, the kinematic coefficient of restitution is the boundary condition defining the particle wall behavior. Four surfaces were studied to simulate the physical conditions of different entrained-flow gasification particlesurface collision scenarios: 1) a flat metal plate 2) a low viscosity silicon adhesive, 3) a high viscosity silicon adhesive, and 4) adhered particles on a flat metal plate with Young's modulus of elasticity ranging from 0.9 to 190GPa. Entrained flow and drop experiments were conducted with granular coke particles, polyethylene beads and polystyrene pellets. The particle normal and tangential coefficients of restitution were measured using high speed imaging and particle tracking. The measured coefficients of restitution were observed to have a strong dependence on the rebound angles for most of the data. Suitable algebraic expressions for the normal and the tangential component of the coefficient of restitution were developed based upon ANOVA analysis. These expressions quantify the effect of normalized Young's modulus, particle equancy, and relative velocity on the coefficient of restitution. The coefficient of restitution did not have a strong dependence on the particle velocity over the range considered as long as the velocity was above the critical velocity. However, strong correlations were found between the degree of equancy of the particles and the mean coefficient of restitution such that the coefficient of restitution decreased for smaller particle equancies. It was concluded that the degree of equancy and the normalized Young's modulus should be considered in applications such as gasification and other cases involving the impact of non-spherical particles and complex surfaces. Sliding was observed when particles impacted on oblique surfaces; however, the resulting effects were within the range of measurement uncertainties.},

For hoppers shaped as general nonaxisymmetric cones, i.e., pyramids, the flow inherits some simplified features from the geometry: similarity solutions can be constructed. Using two different plasticity laws, namely Matsuoka-Nakai and von Mises, those solutions are obtained by solving first-order nonlinear partial differential algebraic systems for stresses, velocities, and a plasticity function. A pseudospectral discretization is applied to both models and the resulting flow fields are examined. Some similarities are found, but important differences appear, especially with regard to velocities near the wall and normal wall stresses. Preliminary comparisons with recent experiments [J.F.

	pages={198-209},
	abstract={Discrete element method (DEM) is a popular numerical method used to understand the discontinuous flow of granular materials and optimise the design and operation of equipment. The impingement of granular material on to flat surfaces can involve complex flow dynamics and can be difficult to model using analytical techniques. There are a vast number of industrial applications where particle-to-structure interactions occur such as belt conveyor impact plate transfer stations consisting of a large number of particles and complex particulate behaviour. Classical analytical methods can be used to provide a quantitative description of the flow of granular material through a transfer point in regards to trajectory and velocity distribution but are generally limited to 2-D analysis. DEM methodology has been well established but there is a lack of detailed validation of DEM models to experimental data and methods to calibrate and scale-up DEM models to attain accurate predictions and results. This paper presents a detailed comparative analysis between classical analytical methods and DEM to predict the flow mechanisms associated with the deformation of granular material impacting a flat plate. Results from DEM simulations and analytical models are compared with experimental results from a variable-geometry conveyor transfer facility to validate and evaluate the numerical methods to solve granular flow problems. The study has focused on evaluating the ability to accurately model material discharge trajectories, the velocity of impact from the inflowing stream, the velocity of the material stream after impingement and the resultant forces on the impact plate. Methods to effectively calibrate the DEM material interaction parameters are also presented and evaluated to quantify the calibration methodology. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted to investigate the variation of DEM parameters and contact models on the impact reaction forces and examine effective techniques to scale parameters to reduce computational time and resources.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of surcharge pressure on wall pressure distribution and arching behavior in mass-flow structures. A method is introduced to measure the hopper wall pressure distribution. The measurements of the wall pressure and critical outlet dimension were conducted under different surcharge pressures and at various filling levels. The experimental results are compared with existing prevailing theories, where the theoretical outlet dimensions demonstrated significant overdesign in terms of low surcharge pressure and reasonable estimates corresponding to high surcharge. The peak wall pressures around the transition area of the bin are smaller than the calculated values, whereas the stresses close to the outlet are larger than the relative theoretical values.},

In general, values of both the mill performance parameters were found to vary significantly with the mill operating conditions. The nature and relative magnitude of variation for the two parameters also differed significantly. Moreover, the effect of any particular variable on the S and F values was found to be significantly different for different sets of operating conditions. It has been emphasized that, as the purpose of grinding is to produce fine particles, the mill design and scale-up work should be based mainly on the F parameters. Moreover, it is not correct to regard the S values to be independent of the mill design and operating variables as a general rule, especially for a fine analysis of the performance of the grinding systems.},

Measurement data of the axial and radial stresses and the axial displacement are recorded for each test. Measurements of fractured iron ore pellets are carried out at different loads giving rise to crushing up to 20% of the total material. From the measured data, the Poisson's ratio, the bulk modulus and a plastic strain hardening function are determined. In addition, friction measurements of iron ore pellets are carried out at different loads and configurations. In conclusion, the test method developed here is usable for the determination of the bulk properties and fracture characteristics of iron ore pellets.},

	volume={210},

	pages={230-240},
	abstract={Discrete element modelling (DEM) is commonly used for particle-scale modelling of granular or particulate materials. Creation of a DEM model requires the specification of a number of micro-structural parameters, including the particle contact stiffness and the interparticle friction. These parameters cannot easily be measured in the laboratory or directly related to measurable, physical material parameters. Therefore, a calibration process is typically used to select the values for use in simulations of physical systems. This paper proposes optimising the DEM calibration process by applying the Taguchi method to analyse the influence of the input parameters on the simulated response of powder agglomerates. The agglomerates were generated in both two and three dimensions by bonding disks and spheres together using parallel bonds. The mechanical response of each agglomerate was measured in a uniaxial compression test simulation where the particle was compressed quasi-statically between stiff, horizontal, frictionless platens. Using appropriate experimental designs revealed the most important parameters to consider for successful calibration of the 2D and 3D models. By analysing the interactive effects, it was also shown that the conventional calibration procedure using a one at a time analysis of the parameters is fundamentally erroneous. The predictive ability of this approach was confirmed with further simulations in both 2D and 3D. This demonstrates that a judicious strategy for application of Taguchi principles can provide a sound and effective calibration procedure.},

These were compared with physical Jenike shear tests conducted on single glass beads and paired glass beads. To separate the influence of sample packing density from interparticle contact friction on the bulk shearing response, the same initial packing was used for each particle shape in the simulations. The interplay between contact friction and particle interlocking arising from geometric interaction between particles to produce the bulk granular friction in a direct shear test is explored and several key observations are reported. The results also show that particle interlocking has a greater effect than packing density on the bulk friction and for each particle shape; DEM can produce a good quantitative match of the limiting bulk friction as long as similar initial packing density is achieved.},

	abstract={Powder shear testing has been used to assess flowability of powders for at least 48years [A.W. Jenike, Storage and Flow of Solids, Bull., Eng. Exp. Station, Univ. Utah, vol. 123, 1964]. A fundamental part of the data interpretation involves construction of Mohrs circles such that they are tangent to the experimental locus; a set of powder shear strengths, measured at variable applied compressive normal stresses. Despite the customary application of this tangency criterion, we have found justifications for it to be scant. In this work, we revisit the Mohrs circle construction and find that proper construction would require measurement of reactionary lateral powder stresses. We further provide reasoning to support placement of the experimental locus passing through the apex (top) of Mohrs circles for isotropic or orthotropic powders and not tangentially to them. This placement is not unexpectedly in agreement with the results of a recent numerical simulation [C. Thornton, L. Zhang, Numerical simulations of the direct shear test, Chem. Eng. Technol. 26 (2) (2003) 153-156], and reveals errors in subsequently calculated constants on the order of 20%.},

	abstract={The yield locus (YL) of powder bed can be used to determine many mechanical properties of a powder such as cohesion, unconfined yield stress, stress ratio, etc. Generally, the YL of powder beds is obtained by fitting the results of shear tests to linear approximations based on the Coulomb equation or to curved approximations based on the Warren-Spring equation. Meanwhile, the yielding characteristics of a powder bed are expressed by the Roscoe condition diagram. In this diagram, the YL appears orthogonal to the normal stress axis at both ends corresponding to tensile and compressive strength. However, the YL approximated by the Coulomb or Warren-Spring equations is not orthogonal to the normal stress axis at both ends, and is not the same shape as the YL shown in Roscoe condition diagrams. Thus, the abovementioned mechanical properties obtained from the YL of a powder bed are likely to be affected by the approximate expression for the YL. Despite this, no one has investigated how the mechanical properties of powder beds such as stress ratios are affected by the approximation method for the YL. In this paper, we propose a new approximation equation for the YL that conforms both to the shape of the YL in the Roscoe condition diagrams and experimental results. Then, these YL obtained by our equation, and by the Coulomb and Warren-Spring equations are used to determine the mechanical and flow properties of powder beds. These values are compared with each other in order to discuss the validity of our equation.},

In the hopper the effect of increasing particle angularity on the flow properties is investigated. Moreover, three different hopper designs are chosen, to further examine the influence of hopper angle and hopper opening size on the flow properties in combination with varying particle shapes. It is demonstrated that particles with an increasing angularity reduce the mass flow rate from the hopper and in case of the flat bottom hopper increase the residual quantity after discharge. In all simulations significant differences between polyhedral and clustered particles were observed, which indicates that the type of particle shape approximation is a parameter that has to be considered in DEM-simulations of hopper discharge.},

The so-called empty annulus effect in the modified Beverloo equation is related to statistical mean particle sizes representing binary mixtures. A general equation is developed in two forms, the first is universal, encompassing both segregating and non-segregating systems, and the second is specific to non-segregating systems.

The stresses and strains that can be applied to a sample are aligned along perpendicular axes, which makes the tester very suitable for fundamental investigation of powder flow. The stress state of powders at a free surface is characterized by the flow function. With this tester the unconfined yield strength can be measured in a single experiment, without extrapolation. The tester has been used to measure the flow function of the standard BCR-limestone powder. It is concluded that the flow function measured with the Jenike Tester is too low. A comparison with other measurements reported in the literature is made and the differences explained. A firm recommendation is made for a reliable procedure.},

Understanding which particle scale properties affect strength will help engineers design better products prior to production, reducing costly mistakes and increasing productivity. This paper examines the relationship between bulk unconfined yield strength and particle shape. It is an experimental work that suggests that the number of particle contacts per adjacent particle and the direction of these contacts are key parameters influencing the bulk strength. This paper suggests a way that shape effects can be incorporated in predictive models relating strength to particle scale parameters.},

	pages={309-315},
	abstract={Abstract The aim of the present study is to evaluate the new approach to dense particulate systems proposed by Jop et al. [1], in the dense regions of a High Shear Granulator (HSG). Wet granulation in high shear mixers is a common process in pharmaceutical technologies and a good understanding of the local mixing and flow patterns is a pre-requisite for this step. In the aforementioned model a dense granular flow is characterized as a visco-plastic fluid. Therefore the local rheology of the system can be predicted assuming averaged and virtual properties and a constant solid volume fraction. A simple disc impeller granulator with glass spheres was chosen for this study. The dynamics of the system have been studied using several techniques including PIV analyses, CFD simulation and image processing. The flow behaviour has been characterized for various impeller speeds and particle loads. Several cases have been analyzed from different aspects both in experiments and through equivalent simulations to evaluate the validity of the model in these particular applications. Results look promising in spite of the simplicity of the model. The model was found to give a good general description of the flow field and bed shape. On the other hand the model is insufficient in some aspects; mostly related to the regions with low volume fraction. The next step would be to combine the model with conventional models on rapid granular flow such as Kinetic Theory of Granular Flows (KTGF).},

Speed, angle and rotation before and after impact have been measured with a strobe and singleframe digital camera. Reproducibility and precision are considerably better than in any previously published work, and have been achieved by careful attention to all aspects of the experiment, including the mechanical and optical systems, illumination, electronic control, computer-based image measurement, and the geometry and condition of the impacting surfaces. All aspects of the rebound dynamics of the elastic spheres, including the motion of the centre of mass and of the contact patch, the spin and the partition of energy, are fully described by the measured variation of the normal and tangential restitution coefficients over the range of impact angles. These measurements show very close agreement with the numerical work of Maw et al. which takes into account the effects of sticking, microslip and tangential compliance. For impacts with a greater obliqueness than about 30 from the normal, the results also agree closely with the classical theory of rigid body sliding.},

	pages={22-32},
	abstract={Abstract We present a simple model for the hydrodynamic drag force acting on the individual N particles of aggregates in uniform flow with low Reynolds number. The present model predicts the shielding effect due to hydrodynamic interactions by considering the individual location and flow direction. The shielding effect of two particles was obtained from curve fitting with the exact solution. Furthermore, the shielding effect of N-particles was extended using scaling laws and curve fitting equations. The present model is advantageous in that it can predict the drag force without considering the fractal dimension. In addition, the hydrodynamic interaction between particles can be calculated without matrix operations. The presented model was verified by calculating the drag acting on aggregates with the Filippov method. Verification conditions were that the number of particles was less than 200, and the fractal dimension was in the range of 1.3 to 2.6. Validation results showed good agreement with Filippov's exact solution. The maximum error for the total drag force is within 5 \%. Finally, we not only applied the drag force model to the discrete element method, but also performed a numerical study of gravitational sedimentation problems at fixed depth.},

	pages={210-216},
	abstract={Abstract In the design of a storage silo usually an axially symmetric state of stress is assumed. However, unsymmetrical pressure distribution may occur because of such factors as: non-uniform humidity of the material, eccentric filling or/and discharge, and additional construction elements inside the deposit. Small internal construction members act similarly to structural imperfection and can initiate buckling, while larger flow obstacles can markedly alter the stress distribution. A study was conducted to numerically simulate the effect of plane (2D) or block (3D) obstruction attached to the wall in a model grain silo holding wheat. This work compares the results of earlier laboratory testing and numerical simulations using the discrete element method (DEM). Series of the DEM simulations were performed with an assembly of 75000 spherical particles with random uniform distribution of diameters with a mean of 3.8 mm and range of +-1\% placed in the cylindrical container with a diameter of 0.12 m. The set-up of DEM simulations reproduced earlier laboratory tests performed in the model grain silo, 1.83 m in diameter with flat floor and corrugated wall. Despite the very large difference in the number of particles in real and simulated deposits, the results of simulations and laboratory testing were in fairly good agreement.},

	abstract={Many characterization techniques are available to determine the flow properties of powders; however, it is debated which method(s) are the most appropriate. In this study, sample fine powders with a medium particle size between 22 and 31 microm were characterized using a variety of techniques that tested powders under different stress states, ranging from static to dynamic. It was found that characterization techniques that were more dynamic such as fluidized bed expansion were best suited for predicting the fluidization performance while characterization techniques that were more static such as cohesion were better for predicting agglomeration. It was also found that results from static and dynamic characterization do not necessarily agree, where fine powders that showed good fluidization performance also displayed increased agglomeration, and vice versa. This suggests that flow properties are dependent upon the stress state and that no single technique is suitable for the full characterization of a powder. In other words, both static and dynamic characterization techniques must be employed to completely understand the flow properties of a powder and predict how it will behave under different process conditions.},

While the measurements to obtain the constitutive equation are performed in a concentric Couette device, the numerical scheme is used to predict the torque and stresses in two additional geometries. These geometries are an eccentric Couette where the inner, rotating cylinder is placed off-center with different eccentricities and a more complicated geometry where a cylindrical body is introduced in the middle between the rotating and stationary cylinders and obstructs part of the shearing gap. The purpose of these calculations is to show the versatility of the numerical solution.},

To simulate the rock flow, pebbles of different sizes were used in the experiments and simulated using clumps of overlapping spheres in the simulations. It was found that the method of deposition of the pebbles into the chute is important to the DEM simulation of the flow of the non-spherical particles. The validated DEM models were used to investigate the relationship between the chute aggregate clearance times, the chute closed-size setting (CSS) and the bite angle. An analysis of both the experimental and DEM studies concluded that both an increase in the bite angle and a decrease in CSS resulted in an increase in the chute clearance times. Moreover, for a constant bite angle, there are two critical CSS values, which depend on the sizes of particles: one which allows pebbles to flow and the other which results in a minimum clearance time.},

Experiments were performed with non-uniform molecular sieve particles (1-3mm diameter) obtained from production line. The particle images are first obtained through digital camera and are then processed by image analysis system. After separating the overlap particles and removing non-target particles of the images, the molecular sieve size and shape are computed in less than 0.9s. The validity of the size measuring accuracy is confirmed through comparing with the results from micrometer. The experimental results show that the repetitive precision of the proposed inspection system is about 1%, the diameter measurement error between image method and micrometer is about 3%, single image inspection speed is around 0.9s/frame. The proposed method is reliable to provide feedback information for control system in rotary drum granulation.},

Thus, unconfined yield strengths of the given samples at various consolidation levels are evaluated solely on the basis of material characteristic parameters, i.e. angle of internal friction, stationary angle of friction, isostatic tensile strength of an unconsolidated powder Â along with characteristic pre-consolidation influence and subsequently predicted flow functions are compared with those evaluated experimentally. The correlation coefficient values for the comparison are found to be in the range of 0.96-0.99, indicating the satisfactory nature of the above parameters in explaining the flow behavior.

	abstract={Abstract The flow properties of bulk materials are influenced by particle shape and particle size, amongst others. Often the particle shape is assumed to be less important in literature. As yet, almost no results are available on the effect of particle shape on the flowability of crushed grain products. Therefore, two test series were performed with two different particle size fractions in the range of 0.2mm. To evaluate the flow properties of the particles, the flowability according to Jenike was applied. In the first test series, the flowability was determined by using a Walker shear cell, and in the second test series by means of a translation shear cell according to Jenike. The particle shape was characterized by the ratio of particle length to particle width (elongation) as well as by the fractionary dimension. As the measurements revealed, the flowability of the crushed grain decreased the more the particle shape deviated from the spherical shape and the roughness of the particle surface increased. As the elongation increased, the tensile strength of both particle size fractions increased and the flowability decreased in the first test series. The same behaviour was observed in the second test series where the fractionary dimension was increased.},

These parameters embody essentially the material properties of the system: stiffness, damping, and friction. In this study, all the parameters are carefully determined experimentally for different operating mill conditions. A computer code based on DEM has been developed to model the motion of the balls in tumbling mills. The code incorporates a scheme to calculate the applied torque, and hence power input to the mill. A 55-cm ball mill is simulated for two different liner cross-sectionsâ€” rectangular and triangular. Results of the simulations pertaining to applied torque are compared with the experiments. It is found that, with a particular model for the coefficient of friction, the predicted torque agrees well with the experiments.},

Experiments were carried out with horizontal wooden rods, and horizontal and vertical thin plates made of mild steel or Teflon. The experimental data are correlated by semi-empirical equations based on the supported mass of pellets in the region above the object, and dynamic friction coefficients acting on vertical surfaces from least-squares regression. Dynamic coefficients of friction for nickel on steel and nickel on Teflon are reported. The correlation is compared with an expression based on Janssen's equation using the experimentally determined coefficients of friction. These results are compared with DEM simulations, which examine the effects of particle size distribution, mass flow rate, plate friction coefficient mi and the simulation parameter K1, which is analogous to a spring constant. The correlation follows the trends of the data and the DEM results agree well with the experimental data over a wide range of conditions. The DEM simulations were carried out on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) that enabled a speed-up factor of 40, and some aspects of the implementation on GPUs are discussed.},

	abstract={Abstract The three phase contact angle between liquids and fine solids is a key design parameter used in the control of the mineral separation, foam stabilisation or antifoaming processes, and therefore the accurate determination of is critical. Commonly used techniques produce variable results and are sensitive to the liquid type or viscosity. Different size ranges of non-porous, spherical glass beads were used to determine the applicability of the sessile drop method on particles forming flat surfaces using different adhesives. Also investigated were the capillary rise and thin layer wicking techniques for the measurements of the contact angle between particles and water or oils of variable viscosity. The measured contact angles between particles and all liquids were compared with the contact angles obtained on the flat glass, made of the same material as the particles. Additionally, some of the particles were chemically modified in order to produce variable range of particle hydrophobicity for further comparison of the technique applicability. The measured contact angles were also qualitatively verified with the particle attachment to the bubble formed in the investigated liquids. Very good agreement between the measured water contact angles on particles using the sessile drop method and the water contact angles measured on flat glass was found for both degrees of glass hydrophobicity. The water contact angles measured of the particles with the capillary rise and thin layer wicking methods were found to be consistently larger, although reliable if considered as advancing contact angles. The contact angles between particles and three different viscosity oils were measured correctly only with the sessile drop method. By comparison, the thin layer wicking and the capillary rise technique produced significant errors. To conclude, the sessile drop on the adhesive slide is the most accurate technique for the measurements of contact angles between particles and water or oils, demonstrating that the technique is independent of the particle size or degree of hydrophobicity.},

The on-line wall friction tester essentially comprises a skid plate that rest on the top free surface of a bulk solid being transported on a conveyor belt. The skid plate is connected to a load cell via a drag link allowing the shear force between the skid plate and bulk solid to be sensed as the latter is conveyed. This paper presents results comparing the on-line tester to the Jenike wall friction tester for two different bulk solids namely: crushed glass and coal. The effect of velocity on the on-line tester has also been studied.},

	pages={1-19},
	abstract={Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of interatomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently those with shortrange forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributedmemory parallel machine which allows for messagepassing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard LennardJones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray YMP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90 and a 1840node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Tradeoffs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.}

	abstract={A new method and equipment for the determination of the vertical tensile strength of bulk solids is described. It allows for the direct determination of the tensile strength of compacted as well as of almost noncompacted powders. For the experiments lactose and corn starch were used as model substances. The cohesion of a powder determined by means of the Jenike shear cell and the tensile strength measured using the new tensile strength tester (TST) were compared. The influence of the powder porosity on the tensile strength and cohesion, respectively was also investigated. As expected the tensile strengths determined by means of the TST are lower than the cohesions obtained from shear cell measurements. However, the ratio of the cohesions of lactose and corn starch determined by using the shear cell is the same as that calculated from results obtained by means of the TST. The results obtained from the Jenike shear cell are much more sensitive to the sample porosity than those from the TST. This observation can be explained by the different measuring principles. In contrast to the TST, the Jenike shear cell method requires that the powders have to be consolidated to a certain state. The new equipment however allows for the determination of the vertical tensile strengths of noncompacted powders.},

In a first study it was shown by comparing experiments on a generic grate with DEM simulations that for a granulate consisting of monodisperse spheres the influence of grate stroke length and bar velocity can be reproduced. Prior to tackling particle assemblies which are polydisperse and consist of particles of complex shape it has to be shown that the influence of particle diameter and material properties of the particles is described correctly by DEM simulations. Thus experiments with monodisperse spheres of three different diameters (5, 10, 20Â mm) and two materials (plastic, wood) are compared to DEM simulations. The mixing process is measured at the front side wall and at the top surface of the particle bed and quantified by image analysis. Both visual observation and mixing parameter results attest a very good agreement between experiments and simulations. The influence of particle diameter and material properties measured in the experiments can be reproduced by DEM simulations.},

To analyze the representative surface segments, the minimum and maximum surface roughness of the lactose tablet is determined in dependence of the segment size. The contact area between the tablet and the particle of lactose was quantified by the tip estimation of Villarrubia. Interparticle forces were measured with force volume scans.

The experiments are simple which show the characteristics of particle flow which differs from fluid flow. The experiments are flow of particles in sedimentation, a U-tube and from a hopper. The CPFD method models the fluid as a fluid and models the particles as discrete particles (material description). The CPFD method is a form of discrete element method, where each particle has three-dimensional forces from fluid drag, gravity, staticâ€“dynamic friction, particle collision and possibly other forces. However, unlike DEM models which calculate particle-to-particle force by a springâ€“damper model and direct particle contact, the CPFD method models collision force on each particle as a spatial gradient. The CPFD numerical method predictions compare well with all three experiments with no adjustment of parameters or empirical correlations between calculations.},

	abstract={Abstract We present theoretical predictions of granular flow in a conical hopper based on a continuum theory employing a recently developed constitutive model with microstructure evolution by Sun and Sundaresan [1]. The model is developed for strain rate-independent granular flows. The closures for the pressure and the macroscopic friction coefficient are linked to microstructure through evolution equations for the coordination number and fabric. The material constants in the model are functions of particle-level properties. A salient prediction is the variable stress ratio along the flow direction, in contrast to the constant ratio employed in some widely used plasticity theories, but supported by results obtained from discrete element simulations. The model permits direct interrogation of the influence of particleparticle friction as well as normal-stress differences on the stress distribution and discharge rate. Increasing particle friction leads to higher stress ratios, but lower normal stress and flow rates, while considering normal-stress differences results in the opposite effects.},

	pages={25-37},
	abstract={The Rankine coefficient is the ratio of the vertical pressure (maximum principal stress) and horizontal pressure (minimum principal stress) acting on a powder bed. The value of the Rankine coefficient is usually determined from the yield locus, which comes from the shear test results either by linear approximation using the Coulomb equation or by curve fitting using the WarrenSpring equation. Since the shape of the yield locus is obtained by approximation, the Rankine coefficient might change with the estimation method. The Rankine coefficient is an important coefficient for estimating the pressure distribution in a powder bed. However, no studies about the effect of the yield locus estimation method on the Rankine coefficient can be found in the past literature. In this paper, first we study the effect of three approximations, i.e. the Coulomb equation, the WarrenSpring equation and an equation proposed by the authors, on the Rankine coefficient. Based on these results, we investigate how the selection of the yield locus estimation method affects the Rankine coefficient. Then we compare the Rankine coefficients obtained from consolidation tests and from each of these yield loci, thereby demonstrating the validity of our proposed approximation equation.},

	number={1},
	pages={61-74},
	abstract={Chemical and mechanical engineers are quite familiar with concepts of fluid flow which include mass and momentum balances and constitutive equations which contain such material characteristics as viscosity and density. Combination of the above correlations yields the well-known Navier-Stokes equations which have to be solved to obtain details of the flow field; a large number of analytical solutions of these equations exist. Somewhat similar equations have been developed for granular materials moving in the rapid granular flow regime, i.e. in the regime in which particle-particle contacts are not very extensive and hence friction is not prevalent. These equations result from a similarity between the movement of molecules and the flow of small elastic (or elasto-plastic) particles and resemble, for certain limiting cases, the fluid flow equations. Slow, frictional flows of powders are different in that particles are in contact for extended periods of time and friction is the overwhelming interaction. Flow in this regime is governed by the same mass and momentum balances but the constitutive equations are different. Only very recently have some of these equations been combined to yield a set of differential equations which take the place of the Navier-Stokes equations; only very few solutions of these equations exist. The present paper describes common features and major dissimilarities between different equations of motion for the above systems and some of their solutions and presents examples and comparisons of powder and fluid flows in identical geometries. Furthermore, general equations of motion for compressible powders in slow flow are developed and an example of an analytical solution is given.},

	abstract={High-energy milling is considered to be one of the most efficient techniques for producing materials that have a well-controlled chemical composition and microstructural features that are difficult to obtain using other synthesis routes. In this study, the mechanical alloying technique (MA) was used to develop special powder metallurgy (PM) steels with two different types of properties. The use of this technique is essential for obtaining the target microstructure, which ensures the desired performance of the resulting material. Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels were produced using MA based on the prealloyed grade steels with the addition of Ti as reinforcements. The incorporation of Ti enables a homogeneous dispersion of nano-oxides and nano-clusters in a submicron-grained structure that should enhance the mechanical properties up to 600. In addition, the base alloying system, should enable the development of protective oxide layers through high-temperature treatments, which improves the compatibility with the environment, avoids liquidmetal embrittlement and contributes to the increase of the mechanical response up to 600. Furthermore, microalloyed powders can be obtained using MA and consolidated with a pressure-assisted sintering process in an attempt to control the final grain size, to achieve microalloyed steels, and to achieve an extraordinary balance of properties.},

Numerical experiments are conducted by means of a modified discrete element method. Emphasis is given to the effects of variables related to factors such as particle characteristics, material properties and geometrical constraints. The results show that under the present simulation conditions, the angle of repose is significantly affected by the sliding and rolling frictions, particle size and container thickness, and is not sensitive to density, Poisson's ratio, damping coefficient and Young's modulus. Increasing rolling or sliding friction coefficient increases the angle of repose, while increasing particle size or container thickness decreases the angle of repose. Based on the numerical results, empirical equations are formulated for engineering application. The proposed simulation technique and equations are validated by comparing the physical and numerical experiments, where focus is given to the effects of particle size and container thickness.},
