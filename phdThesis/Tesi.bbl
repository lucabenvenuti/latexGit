  Particulate systems are of interest in many disciplines. They are often
  investigated using the discrete element method because of its capability to
  investigate particulate systems at the individual particle scale. To model
  the interaction between two particles and between a particle and a boundary,
  conventional discrete element models use springs and dampers in both the
  normal and tangential directions. The significance of particle rotation has
  been highlighted in both numerical studies and physical experiments. Several
  researchers have attempted to incorporate a rotational torque to account for
  the rolling resistance or rolling friction by developing different models.
  This paper presents a review of the commonly used models for rolling
  resistance and proposes a more general model. These models are classified
  into four categories according to their key characteristics. The robustness
  of these models in reproducing rolling resistance effects arising from
  different physical situations was assessed by using several benchmarking test
  cases. The proposed model can be seen to be more general and suitable for
  modelling problems involving both dynamic and pseudo-static regimes. An
  example simulation of the formation of a 2D sandpile is also shown. For
  simplicity, all formulations and examples are presented in 2D form, though
  the general conclusions are also applicable to 3D systems.%

  The simulation of very dense particle regimes such as moving or fluidized
  beds requires a well determined coefficient of friction, which characterizes
  the inter-particle friction force. Starting from rough guide values available
  in the literature, we determine the exact parameters by fitting numerical
  simulations to experimental measurements of a simplified Jenike shear tester.
  The open-source, discrete-element-method code LIGGGHTS is capable to model
  complex geometries built of triangulated meshes. In addition to preloading
  the bulk solid in the shear cell by a required constant principal stress, a
  new wall type is enhanced by a controller prescribing the wall motion. A
  comprehensive sensitivity study shows that the results are nearly insensitive
  to the spatial dimensions of the shear tester as well as all other material
  parameters. Therefore, this set-up is applicable to determine the coefficient
  of friction. Finally, we calculate the coefficient of friction of glass beads
  showing very good agreement with literature data and in-house experiments.
  Hence, this procedure can be used to deduce material parameters for the
  numerical simulation of dense granular flows.%

  Abstract Studying the flow of granular materials is important for its impact
  on both industrial applications and natural phenomena. A fundamental
  understanding of the flow of granular materials is lacking, and this results
  in difficulties in modeling and predicting their flow behavior. The discrete
  element method (DEM) is often used as the â€œgold standardâ€ both
  for predicting the results of experiments as well as for comparison to
  continuum-level theories of granular material flows due to its derivation
  from first-principal constructs, like contact mechanics. In this paper, we
  continue our work on quantitative validation of DEM simulations using
  detailed measurements of simple, well-characterized flows that allow us to
  examine the effect of rough surfaces and rotational rates on granular flow
  using an annular shear cell. Experimentally, we use digital particle tracking
  velocimetry (DPTV) to obtain velocity, solids fraction, and granular
  temperature profiles. Computationally, we compare the results obtained using
  different contact mechanics force laws to those from experimental
  measurements as well as perform a sensitivity analysis on device and particle
  geometry and different material properties employed. In previous work on
  stainless steel beads, we have found that an elasto-plastic normal force
  model is critical to obtaining accurate results as is detailed matching of
  both particle and system geometry, while the choice of friction model is
  found to be unimportant. Here, we examine the robustness of these
  observations to both particle materials properties as well as systemic
  variables (such as total system solids fraction). We find that the choice of
  frictional force model has little effect across all the profiles and all
  models, while the accuracy of the normal force model is material-dependent.%

  A hybrid neural network model is designed to predict the micro-macroscopic
  characteristics of particulate systems subjected to shearing. The network is
  initially trained to understand the micro-mechanical characteristics of
  particulate assemblies, by feeding the results based on three-dimensional
  discrete element simulations. Given the physical properties of the individual
  particles and the packing condition of the particulate assemblies under
  specified loading conditions, the network thus understands the way contact
  forces are distributed, the orientation of contact (fabric) networks and the
  evolution of stress tensor during the mechanical loading. These relationships
  are regarded as soft sensors. Using the signals received from soft sensors, a
  mechanistic neural network model is constructed to establish the relationship
  between the micro-macroscopic characteristics of granular assemblies
  subjected to shearing. The macroscopic results obtained form this hybrid
  mechanistic neural network modelling for data that were not part of the
  training signals, is compared with simulations based on discrete element
  modelling alone and in general, the agreement is good. The hybrid network
  responds to their inputs at a high speed and can be regarded as a real-time
  system for understanding the complex behaviour of particulate systems under
  mechanical process conditions.%

  Powder die fill (PDF) process prior to compaction affects spatial density of
  the final part and its in-service performance. Inhomogeneous density leads to
  part distortion (or warpage) during sintering, resulting in inability to get
  the desired dimensional tolerances and mechanical properties in the final
  product. Therefore, to improve quality of the final part, it is important to
  eliminate several causes of non-uniformity during the powder die filling
  stage. This experimental study relates to some new approaches toward
  characterization of PDF process, using an experimental apparatus with
  transparent shoe and die sections. In this paper, the influence of a newly
  designed perforated plate (PP), incorporated at the bottom of the feed shoe
  on PDF is studied. The effect of PP on powder redistribution in the feed
  shoe, powder transfer and resulting powder spatial density uniformity, and
  porosity within a thin ring-shaped die is compared with the powder flow and
  segregation behavior in standard shoe (SS) filling. Various colored salt
  powder experiments using arrangements in layers and columns within the feed
  shoe as well as a commercial iron power are considered in an attempt to
  analyze the subsequent powder redistribution within the shoe, during shoe
  motion and final powder packing in the die. It is determined that the colored
  salt is a promising medium for simulating the flow characteristics and
  segregation of commercial iron powder macroscopically. Further, critical shoe
  speed for powder delivery into the die-cavity using a perforated plate and a
  standard shoe are studied. Continuous imaging of the transparent shoe and die
  wall sections with an on-line high speed CCD camera are also used to record
  powder flow and to obtain resulting porosity from quantitative pixel-based
  analysis of the post-fill final images. The effectiveness and limitations of
  the perforated plate in achieving a more homogenous powder fill and reduced
  porosity in the die is explained with the help of both colored powder
  experiments and the surface porosity data from the transparent die face
  section. Finally, a successful attempt is made to bind the loose iron powder
  using a polymer resin blend into the shape of a ring within the die. This
  ring shaped component is then analyzed for its spatial porosity distribution,
  and thereby its spatial density distribution, using gamma ray densitometry.%

  Abstract An accurate correlation for the smooth sphere drag coefficient with
  wide range of applicability is a useful tool in the field of particle
  technology. The present study focuses on the development of high accurate
  drag coefficient correlations from low to very high Reynolds numbers (up to
  106) using a multi-gene Genetic Programming (GP) procedure. A clear
  superiority of GP over other methods is that GP is able to determine the
  structure and parameters of the model, simultaneously, while the structure of
  the model is imposed by the user in traditional regression analysis, and only
  the parameters of the model are assigned. In other words, in addition to the
  parameters of the model, the structure of it can be optimized using GP
  approach. Among two new and high accurate models of the present study, one of
  them is acceptable for the region before drag dip, and the other is
  applicable for the whole range of Reynolds numbers up to 106 including the
  transient region from laminar to turbulent. The performances of the developed
  models are examined and compared with other reported models. The results
  indicate that these models respectively give 16.2 \% and 69.4 \% better
  results than the best existing correlations in terms of the sum of squared of
  logarithmic deviations (SSLD). On the other hand, the proposed models are
  validated with experimental data. The validation results show that all of the
  estimated drag coefficients are within the bounds of +- 7 \% of experimental
  values.%

  Abstract Wet granulation is a particle design process, often used in the
  pharmaceutical, consumer product, food, and fertilizer industries. A better
  process understanding is needed to improve process design, control, and
  optimization. Predominantly, two modeling frameworks are implemented to
  simulate granulation processes: population balance modeling (PBM) and
  discrete element methods (DEM). While PBM simulates changes in the number of
  particles in each size class due to rate processes such as aggregation, DEM
  tracks each particle individually, with the abilities to simulate spatial
  variations and collect mechanistic data. In this bi-directional coupled
  approach, the computational expenditure of the full model is overwhelmed by
  the high-fidelity DEM algorithm that needs to solve a set of ODEs for each
  and every particle being handled in the system for very small time intervals.
  To mitigate this computational inefficiency, reduced order modeling (ROM) is
  used to replace the computationally expensive DEM step. An artificial neural
  network (ANN) was trained using DEM results to relate particle size, size
  distribution, and impeller speed to the collision frequency. Results showed a
  high correlation between the trained ANN predictions and DEM-generated data.
  The ANN was coupled with a PBM as a key component of the aggregation rate
  kernel. The coupled model showed a different development of average particle
  size and size distribution over time from that of a constant aggregation rate
  kernel. In addition, the coupled model demonstrated sensitivity to the
  impeller speed via the ANN rate kernel. When compared with the fully coupled
  PBM-DEM model for accuracy and computation time savings, the hybrid PBM-ANN
  model demonstrated excellent agreement with DEM simulations at fractions of
  the original computational time.%

  Abstract The appropriate choice of contact parameters is of great importance,
  particularly when simulations using the discrete element method (DEM) are run
  with the aim of capturing quantitative information on collision events that
  occur among the individual particles, as what happens during handling of iron
  ore pellets. The paper analyzes the use of tests conducted with single
  pellets for estimating material and contact parameters that are required in
  DEM simulations using the no-slip Hertz-Mindlin model. Tests included impact
  load cell, tribometer, drop tests and a simple test in which the rolling
  angle of individual pellets is measured. It is concluded that, provided
  particle shapes are described appropriately, DEM simulations provide
  reasonably realistic predictions of pellet motion in assemblies from contact
  parameters measured on the basis of single-particle tests. In this case the
  physical significance of the contact parameters is maintained. However, if
  pellets are described in a simplistic way as spheres, then the DEM simulation
  of their flow no longer matches the experimental results, requiring fitting
  some of the contact parameters in order to match the observed global flow, so
  that much of the physical meaning of the parameters is lost.%

  Abstract Mathematical models of pneumatic conveying in dilute mode of flow
  have been presented by many researchers. Continuum approach is the most
  commonly used approach of modeling this kind of flow. In the present work a
  mathematical model has been developed which is in the form of governing
  equations such as continuity, momentum and energy equation. Energy equation
  has been written including a parameter called granular temperature. In this
  model, the dilute mode of conveying has been described as chaotically moving
  particles as granular gas characterized by granular temperature. Simulations
  have been performed in order to predict different parameters. The predicted
  pressure drop values were found to be in good agreement with the experimental
  data. Variations of important parameters such as absolute pressure, granular
  temperature along the length of the pipeline have been analyzed for different
  values of normal and restitution coefficients.%

  Abstract Handling of granular materials involves the use of many solids
  processing devices such as chutes, hoppers, tumblers or other transfer
  equipment. Unfortunately, granular materials segregate if they are subjected
  to flow or external agitation in the presence of a gravitational field. Thus,
  operation of many of these devices is prone to segregation. Many studies of
  granular flow have focused on gravity driven chute flows owing to their
  practical importance in granular processing and to the fact that the relative
  simplicity of this type of flow allows for development and testing of new
  theories/equipment. In the present work, we observe the deposition behavior
  of both mono-sized and polydisperse dry granular materials in an inclined
  chute flow, both experimentally and computationally. We investigate the
  effects on the mass fraction distribution of granular materials of different
  parameters such as chute angle, particle size, falling height and charge
  amount. The simulation results obtained using the Discrete Element Method
  (DEM) are compared with the experimental findings and a high degree of
  agreement is observed. Tuning of the underlying contact force parameters
  allows realistic results and is used as a means of validating the simulation
  model against available experimental data. The tuned simulation is then used
  to test predictions of granular segregation theories outlined in previous
  studies. That is, it has been predicted that a system can maintain a mixed
  configuration when L<Uavgts, where L, Uavg, and ts denote the length of the
  chute, the average stream-wise flow velocity of the particles, and the
  characteristic time of segregation, respectively. Our results with the tuned
  simulation support these conclusions for chute flows.%

  Abstract Truncated spherical harmonic expansions are used to approximate the
  shape of 3D star-shaped particles including a wide range of axially symmetric
  ellipsoids, cuboids, and over 40.000 real particles drawn from seven
  different material sources. This mathematical procedure enables any geometric
  property to be calculated for these star-shaped particles. Calculations are
  made of properties such as volume, surface area, triaxial dimensions, the
  maximum inscribed sphere, and the minimum enclosing sphere, as well as
  differential geometric properties such as surface normals and principal
  curvatures, and the values are compared to the analytical values for
  well-characterized geometric shapes. We find that a particle's Krumbein
  triaxial dimensions, widely used in the sedimentary geology literature, are
  essentially identical numerically to the length, width, and thickness
  dimensions that are used to characterize gravel shape in the construction
  aggregate industry. Of these dimensions, we prove that the length is a lower
  bound on a particle's minimum enclosing sphere diameter and that the
  thickness is an upper bound on its maximum inscribed sphere diameter. We
  examine the â€œtrue sphericityâ€ and the shape entropy, and we also
  introduce a new sphericity factor based on the radius ratio of the maximum
  inscribed sphere to the minimum enclosing sphere. This bounding sphere ratio,
  which can be calculated numerically or approximated from macroscopic
  dimensions, has the advantage that it is less sensitive to surface roughness
  than the true sphericity. For roundness, we extend Wadell's classical 2D
  definition for particle silhouettes to 3D shapes and we also introduce a new
  roundness factor based on integrating the dot product of the surface position
  unit vector and the unit normal vector. Limited evidence suggests that the
  latter roundness factor more faithfully captures the common notion of
  roundness based on visual perception of particle shapes, and it is
  significantly simpler to calculate than the classical roundness factor.%

  An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed for modeling the
  effect of the amount of a process control agent (PCA) on the apparent
  density, particle size and microhardness of Al-10Â wt.%Al2O3 composite
  powders. Methanol was used as the process control agent in varying amounts of
  1, 2, and 3wt.% to investigate the effect of the PCA on the properties of the
  composite powders. Composite powders were fabricated using high energy
  planetary ball milling, and the training data for the ANN were collected from
  experimental results. After the training process, the experimental data were
  used to verify the accuracy of the system. The properties of the composite
  powders were analyzed using a hall flowmeter for the apparent density, a
  laser particle size analyzer for the particle size, a microhardness tester
  for the powder microhardness and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the
  powder morphology. The two input parameters in the proposed ANN were the
  amount of methanol and duration of the milling process. Apparent density,
  particle size and microhardness of the composite powders were the outputs
  obtained from the proposed ANN. As a result of this study the ANN was found
  to be successful for predicting the apparent density, particle size and
  microhardness of Alâ€“Al2O3 composite powders. The mean absolute
  percentage error (MAPE) for the predicted values didn't exceed 4.93%. This
  model can be used for predicting Al-Al2O3 composite powder properties
  produced with different amounts of methanol and using different milling
  times.%

  Abstract An online machine vision inspection method is proposed to implement
  feedback control of molecular sieve growth process in rotary drum
  granulation. An experimental platform, comprising of a high-resolution
  digital camera and an image analysis system, has been developed to confirm
  the validity of the method on particle size distribution (PSD) and sphericity
  measurements. Experiments were performed with non-uniform molecular sieve
  particles (1-3mm diameter) obtained from production line. The particle images
  are first obtained through digital camera and are then processed by image
  analysis system. After separating the overlap particles and removing
  non-target particles of the images, the molecular sieve size and shape are
  computed in less than 0.9s. The validity of the size measuring accuracy is
  confirmed through comparing with the results from micrometer. The
  experimental results show that the repetitive precision of the proposed
  inspection system is about 1%, the diameter measurement error between image
  method and micrometer is about 3%, single image inspection speed is around
  0.9s/frame. The proposed method is reliable to provide feedback information
  for control system in rotary drum granulation.%

  circular particle DEM model under-predicts the shoulder, toe and vortex
  center positions and the power draw by around 10 degrees. The effect of
  particle shape and the dimensionality of the model are also assessed, with

  While the discrete element method (DEM) is attracting increasing interest for
  the simulation of industrial granular flow, much of the previous DEM
  modelling has considered two-dimensional (2D) flows and used circular
  particles. The inclusion of particle shape into DEM models is very important
  and allows many flow features, particularly in hoppers, to be more accurately
  reproduced than was possible when using only circular particles. Elongated
  particles are shown here to produce flow rates up to 30% lower than for
  circular particles and give flow patterns that are quite different. The
  yielding of the particle microstructure resembles more the tearing of a
  continuum solid, with large-scale quasi-stable voids being formed and large
  groups of particles moving together. The flow becomes increasingly
  concentrated in a relatively narrow funnel above the hopper opening. This
  encourages the hope that DEM may be able to predict important problems such
  as bridging and rat-holing. Increasing the blockiness or angularity of the
  particles is also shown to increase resistance to flow and reduces the flow
  rates by up to 28%, but without having perceptible effect on the nature of
  the flow. We also describe our methodology for constructing and modelling
  geometrically complex industrial applications in three dimensions and present
  a series of industrially important three-dimensional (3D) case studies. The
  charge motion in a 5 m diameter ball mill and in a Hicom nutating mill,
  discharge from single- and four-port cylindrical hoppers, and particle size
  separation by a vibrating screen are demonstrated. For each case, plausible
  particle size distributions (PSDs) have been used. The results obtained
  indicate that DEM modelling is now sufficiently advanced that it can make
  useful contributions to process optimisation and equipment design. Finally
  the parallelisation of such a DEM code is described and benchmark performance
  results for a large-scale 2D hopper flow are presented.%

  Abstract The increased necessity to obtain energy from other sources than
  conventional fossil fuels has led to the growing interest in solar energy.
  The problem with the proposed technology is that it can only provide power
  during the day and therefore requires some sort of storage system, if power
  is to be supplied throughout the day and night. A number of storage systems
  exist, but the one of particular interest is packed rock beds. Discrete
  Element Models (DEM) of rock beds were developed through both experimental
  and numerical procedures, by conducting a series of sensitivity and
  calibration studies. Through these procedures, a set of microproperties could
  be determined to accurately model the rock particles. The properties were
  verified by modelling the discharge from a hopper with three different
  opening widths. Further, the research focused on the potential of
  constructing self-supporting tunnels within the rock beds in order to improve
  the air flow through the bed by minimizing the pressure drop. Horizontal and
  vertical tunnels were investigated, each with different diameters. It was
  observed that if the appropriate steps were followed, stable self-supporting
  tunnels could be formed using particles of different scale.%

  AbstractPurpose The purpose of the study was to understand the role of
  particle size and shape changes in modifying agglomerate strength
  distribution and de-agglomeration of cohesive lactose powders. Methods The
  relative de-agglomeration of three lactoses of different particle size
  distributions (Lactohale 201 or LH201, Lactohale 210 or LH210 and Lactohale
  220 or LH220) was determined from laser diffraction particle sizing of the
  aerosol plume at different air flow rates. The agglomerate strength
  distributions were estimated by Monte Carlo simulation using the primary
  particle size, work of cohesion and tapped density distributions determined
  by laser diffraction, inverse gas chromatography and tapping apparatus,
  respectively. The morphology and particle shape parameters were determined by
  scanning electron microscopy and the Morphologi G3. Results The estimated
  agglomerate strength correlated well with the de-agglomeration of all lactose
  samples at different air flow rates. While the work of cohesion of the
  lactose samples was not significantly different, the packing fraction was
  dependent on the proportion and shape of intermediate-sized, cohesive
  particles between 5.4 and 14micron. For example, while the proportion of
  particles . Conclusion The study reinforced the role of agglomerate strength
  distributions in understanding de-agglomeration of cohesive materials.
  Modification of particle size distributions and shape characteristics
  contributed to the agglomerate strength changes in the lactose samples. The
  study enhanced the fundamental understanding of powder de-agglomeration and
  provided strategic approaches that could be used to improve inhalation
  product performance.%

  This paper presents segregation of powder mixtures in silos of different
  scale on the basis of recent experimental findings with binary and ternary
  mixtures as well as commercial construction materials. Dimensional analysis
  is performed to reduce the number of variables and to bring forth
  dimensionless groups. Based on these experimental correlations (models) are
  proposed for describing the concentration of fine particles at the walls as a
  result of silo filling and segregation towards the end of complete discharge.
  Parameters of both models are fitted to experimental data using the method of
  least sum of squares. The filling model shows good agreement with
  experimental data and the description of segregation at discharge is in
  general agreement with experimental findings. Important variables for the
  distribution of particles at silo filling include the mass fraction of fines,
  particle size ratio (coarse/fine), particle solid density ratio
  (coarse/fine), free fall distance, silo diameter and inlet diameter. On the
  basis of the proposed model for silo filling, the concentration of fine
  particles at the silo walls increases with increasing fines content, size
  ratio and density ratio for the powder mixture, as well as the ratio for free
  fall distance and silo diameter and the ratio for silo diameter and inlet
  diameter. This result is in general agreement with the findings of other
  investigators, but the observation that segregation at silo discharge is, to
  a large extent, determined by the material distribution at filling is new and
  interesting. This confirms the qualitative conclusions of earlier work by the
  authors and shows that mass flow designs do not always entirely correct for
  side-to-side segregation patterns (induced during filling) at silo discharge.
  The findings of this paper should be of considerable interest to producers of
  construction materials and to other industries where segregation of powder
  mixtures in silos is a major concern.%

  Abstract We have developed a direct numerical simulation approach combined
  with the immersed boundary (DNS-IB) method for studying heat transfer in
  particulate flows. In this method, fluid velocity and temperature fields are
  obtained by solving the modified momentum and heat transfer equations, which
  are due to the presence of heated particles in the fluid; particles are
  tracked individually and their velocities and positions are solved based on
  the equations of linear and angular motions; particle temperature is assumed
  to be constant. The momentum and heat exchanges between a particle and the
  surrounding fluid at its surface are resolved using the immersed boundary
  method with the direct forcing scheme. The DNS-IB method has been used to
  study the heat transfer of 225 heated spheres in a fluidized bed. By
  exploring the rich data generated from the DNS-IB simulations, we are able to
  obtain statistically averaged fluid and particle velocities as well as the
  overall heat transfer rate in the fluidized bed. Good agreement between the
  current study and the one by Pan et al. (2002) is found for the hydrodynamic
  properties of the bed such as pressure gradients within the bed and the
  relationship between fluidization velocity and bed solid fraction. The
  particle-averaged Nusselt number is found to increase as the fluidization
  velocity increases and the bed height rises; particles at the entrance of the
  bed tend to have the maximum heat transfer rate because of the higher
  particle-fluid temperature gradients in this region; as the fluid moves
  upward in the bed, it gets warmer, which reduces particle-fluid temperature
  gradients and decreases the transfer rate of particles.%

  Much research regarding handling and storage characteristics of bulk solids
  has been conducted over the years. Physical properties of granular solids
  play a significant role in their resulting storage and flow behaviour, and
  are therefore essential to design appropriate, efficient, and economic bulk
  solids handling and storage equipment and structures. Distillers Dried Grains
  with Solubles (DDGS) is a bulk material that has been widely used as a
  protein source for ruminants and non-ruminants for more than two decades.
  Distillers grains are energy and nutrient dense, and are often used as a
  replacement for corn in animal diets. With the exponential growth of the fuel
  ethanol industry in the last few years, large quantities of distiller's
  grains are now being produced. To effectively utilize these feeds in domestic
  and international markets, however, these co-product streams are increasingly
  being transported greater distances, and must be stored until final use. DDGS
  flow is problematic as it often becomes restricted by caking and bridging
  which occurs during transportation and storage. This issue probably results
  from a number of factors, including storage moisture, temperature, relative
  humidity, particle size, time, or temperature variations, to name a few. The
  objective of this study was to review the primary factors affecting
  flowability, handling, and storage of granular solids and powders, as well as
  appropriate testing methodologies for these materials. Considering these will
  be helpful when examining granular flowability and storage challenges for
  byproduct feeds, including those surrounding the use of DDGS.%

  The word characterisation as applied to bulk powders may include many
  different physical properties depending on the process that the powder must
  undergo during manufacture or the use to which it is to be put by the
  customer. In industrial processes the terms cohesion and flowability are in
  common use, the former being, roughly, the resistance of the powder to flow
  and some researchers prefer to use the inverse of cohesion as a measure of a
  powder's flowability. In this paper we present some of the work we have done
  to compare some devices that use the Jenike theory for measuring the shear
  strength of mixtures of alumina powders in order to arrive at values for
  cohesion, with an instrument that measures cohesion directly. We also compare
  the inverse of cohesion with angle of repose of the same dry powders. It is
  our opinion that while measurements of shear strength are essential for the
  proper design of storage vessels, for the purpose of monitoring the flow
  behaviour of bulk powders on a daytoday basis, it is simpler and quicker to
  measure powder flowability more directly using angle of repose using a
  standard technique. Most of our experiments were carried out on blends of
  fine and coarse alumina, but some recent results on natural organic products
  having non-spherical shapes are also presented.%

  Abstract New robust Lagrangian computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models are
  powerful tools that can be used to study the behavior of a diverse population
  of coal particle sizes, densities, and mineral compositions in entrained
  gasifiers. By using this approach, the responses of the particles impacting
  the wall were characterized over a range of velocities (1 to 8m/s) and
  incident angles (90 to 20). Within CFD models, the kinematic coefficient of
  restitution is the boundary condition defining the particle wall behavior.
  Four surfaces were studied to simulate the physical conditions of different
  entrained-flow gasification particlesurface collision scenarios: 1) a flat
  metal plate 2) a low viscosity silicon adhesive, 3) a high viscosity silicon
  adhesive, and 4) adhered particles on a flat metal plate with Young's modulus
  of elasticity ranging from 0.9 to 190GPa. Entrained flow and drop experiments
  were conducted with granular coke particles, polyethylene beads and
  polystyrene pellets. The particle normal and tangential coefficients of
  restitution were measured using high speed imaging and particle tracking. The
  measured coefficients of restitution were observed to have a strong
  dependence on the rebound angles for most of the data. Suitable algebraic
  expressions for the normal and the tangential component of the coefficient of
  restitution were developed based upon ANOVA analysis. These expressions
  quantify the effect of normalized Young's modulus, particle equancy, and
  relative velocity on the coefficient of restitution. The coefficient of
  restitution did not have a strong dependence on the particle velocity over
  the range considered as long as the velocity was above the critical velocity.
  However, strong correlations were found between the degree of equancy of the
  particles and the mean coefficient of restitution such that the coefficient
  of restitution decreased for smaller particle equancies. It was concluded
  that the degree of equancy and the normalized Young's modulus should be
  considered in applications such as gasification and other cases involving the
  impact of non-spherical particles and complex surfaces. Sliding was observed
  when particles impacted on oblique surfaces; however, the resulting effects
  were within the range of measurement uncertainties.%

  We perform careful experiments in a turnable cell to determine the angle of
  repose and various other angles of dry granular materials. We study the
  dependence of the angle on the presence of walls and find an exponential
  decay on the distance between the walls. Modification of the granular fabric
  close to the surface changes the static angle of repose and the effect can
  still be noted after several inclinations of the cell indicating the
  existence of a memory effect. The dynamic angle of repose is particularly
  small after the first inclination of the cell. When part of the heap is
  removed through an outlet, three different angles are obtained showing the
  effect of fabric and heap preparation on the dynamic angle.%

  Similarity solutions are constructed for the flow of granular materials

  nonaxisymmetric containers. The model involves ten unknowns (stresses,
  velocity, and plasticity function) determined by nine nonlinear first order
  partial differential equations together with a quadratic algebraic constraint
  (yield condition). A pseudospectral discretization is applied; the resulting

  Gravity flows of granular materials through hoppers are considered. For
  hoppers shaped as general nonaxisymmetric cones, i.e., pyramids, the flow
  inherits some simplified features from the geometry: similarity solutions can
  be constructed. Using two different plasticity laws, namely Matsuoka-Nakai
  and von Mises, those solutions are obtained by solving first-order nonlinear
  partial differential algebraic systems for stresses, velocities, and a
  plasticity function. A pseudospectral discretization is applied to both
  models and the resulting flow fields are examined. Some similarities are
  found, but important differences appear, especially with regard to velocities
  near the wall and normal wall stresses. Preliminary comparisons with recent
  experiments [J.F. Wambaugh, R.P. Behringer, Asymmetry-induced circulation in
  granular hopper flows, in: R. Garcia-Rojo, H.J. Herrmann, S. McNamara (Eds.),
  Powders and Grains, 2005, pp. 915-918] based on the present results indicate
  that for slow granular flows the lesser known Matsuoka-Nakai plasticity law
  yields better results than more common models based on a von Mises
  criterion.%

  Discrete element method (DEM) is a popular numerical method used to
  understand the discontinuous flow of granular materials and optimise the
  design and operation of equipment. The impingement of granular material on to
  flat surfaces can involve complex flow dynamics and can be difficult to model
  using analytical techniques. There are a vast number of industrial
  applications where particle-to-structure interactions occur such as belt
  conveyor impact plate transfer stations consisting of a large number of
  particles and complex particulate behaviour. Classical analytical methods can
  be used to provide a quantitative description of the flow of granular
  material through a transfer point in regards to trajectory and velocity
  distribution but are generally limited to 2-D analysis. DEM methodology has
  been well established but there is a lack of detailed validation of DEM
  models to experimental data and methods to calibrate and scale-up DEM models
  to attain accurate predictions and results. This paper presents a detailed
  comparative analysis between classical analytical methods and DEM to predict
  the flow mechanisms associated with the deformation of granular material
  impacting a flat plate. Results from DEM simulations and analytical models
  are compared with experimental results from a variable-geometry conveyor
  transfer facility to validate and evaluate the numerical methods to solve
  granular flow problems. The study has focused on evaluating the ability to
  accurately model material discharge trajectories, the velocity of impact from
  the inflowing stream, the velocity of the material stream after impingement
  and the resultant forces on the impact plate. Methods to effectively
  calibrate the DEM material interaction parameters are also presented and
  evaluated to quantify the calibration methodology. A sensitivity analysis has
  been conducted to investigate the variation of DEM parameters and contact
  models on the impact reaction forces and examine effective techniques to
  scale parameters to reduce computational time and resources.%

  Abstract Based on Jenike's method, only the self-weight of each arch element
  is involved in the calculation of the arch thickness parameter which leads to
  the surcharge pressure not being taken into account in determining the
  critical outlet dimension of a bulk material storage bin. The aim of this
  study is to investigate the influence of surcharge pressure on wall pressure
  distribution and arching behavior in mass-flow structures. A method is
  introduced to measure the hopper wall pressure distribution. The measurements
  of the wall pressure and critical outlet dimension were conducted under
  different surcharge pressures and at various filling levels. The experimental
  results are compared with existing prevailing theories, where the theoretical
  outlet dimensions demonstrated significant overdesign in terms of low
  surcharge pressure and reasonable estimates corresponding to high surcharge.
  The peak wall pressures around the transition area of the bin are smaller
  than the calculated values, whereas the stresses close to the outlet are
  larger than the relative theoretical values.%

  Abstract With a view to developing a sound basis for the design and scale-up
  of ball mills, a large amount of data available in the literature were
  analyzed for variation of the two key mill performance parameters: power
  specific values of the absolute breakage rate of the coarsest size fraction,
  S, and absolute rate of production of fines, F, with some of the important
  operating and design variables such as the mill speed, ball load, particle
  load, ball diameter and mill diameter. In general, values of both the mill
  performance parameters were found to vary significantly with the mill
  operating conditions. The nature and relative magnitude of variation for the
  two parameters also differed significantly. Moreover, the effect of any
  particular variable on the S and F values was found to be significantly
  different for different sets of operating conditions. It has been emphasized
  that, as the purpose of grinding is to produce fine particles, the mill
  design and scale-up work should be based mainly on the F parameters.
  Moreover, it is not correct to regard the S values to be independent of the
  mill design and operating variables as a general rule, especially for a fine
  analysis of the performance of the grinding systems.%

  Abstract In this work, an experimental method for measuring the bulk
  properties and fracture loading relations for iron ore pellets is presented.
  Knowledge on the bulk behaviour and fracture data for iron ore pellets is of
  great importance for improving the material transportation systems and to
  increase the product quality. Trustworthy numerical simulations of iron ore
  pellets also demand reliable material data for the models. Here, instrumented
  confined compression tests are carried out at different load levels.
  Measurement data of the axial and radial stresses and the axial displacement
  are recorded for each test. Measurements of fractured iron ore pellets are
  carried out at different loads giving rise to crushing up to 20% of the total
  material. From the measured data, the Poisson's ratio, the bulk modulus and a
  plastic strain hardening function are determined. In addition, friction
  measurements of iron ore pellets are carried out at different loads and
  configurations. In conclusion, the test method developed here is usable for
  the determination of the bulk properties and fracture characteristics of iron
  ore pellets.%

  Discrete element modelling (DEM) is commonly used for particle-scale
  modelling of granular or particulate materials. Creation of a DEM model
  requires the specification of a number of micro-structural parameters,
  including the particle contact stiffness and the interparticle friction.
  These parameters cannot easily be measured in the laboratory or directly
  related to measurable, physical material parameters. Therefore, a calibration
  process is typically used to select the values for use in simulations of
  physical systems. This paper proposes optimising the DEM calibration process
  by applying the Taguchi method to analyse the influence of the input
  parameters on the simulated response of powder agglomerates. The agglomerates
  were generated in both two and three dimensions by bonding disks and spheres
  together using parallel bonds. The mechanical response of each agglomerate
  was measured in a uniaxial compression test simulation where the particle was
  compressed quasi-statically between stiff, horizontal, frictionless platens.
  Using appropriate experimental designs revealed the most important parameters
  to consider for successful calibration of the 2D and 3D models. By analysing
  the interactive effects, it was also shown that the conventional calibration
  procedure using a one at a time analysis of the parameters is fundamentally
  erroneous. The predictive ability of this approach was confirmed with further
  simulations in both 2D and 3D. This demonstrates that a judicious strategy
  for application of Taguchi principles can provide a sound and effective
  calibration procedure.%

  In this study, the discrete element method (DEM) was used to investigate the
  influence of particle shape and interparticle friction on the bulk friction
  in a Jenike direct shear test. Spherical particle and non-spherical particles
  using two overlapping sphere giving particle aspect ratio of up to 2 and a
  full range of interparticle contact friction coefficient were studied
  numerically. These were compared with physical Jenike shear tests conducted
  on single glass beads and paired glass beads. To separate the influence of
  sample packing density from interparticle contact friction on the bulk
  shearing response, the same initial packing was used for each particle shape
  in the simulations. The interplay between contact friction and particle
  interlocking arising from geometric interaction between particles to produce
  the bulk granular friction in a direct shear test is explored and several key
  observations are reported. The results also show that particle interlocking
  has a greater effect than packing density on the bulk friction and for each
  particle shape; DEM can produce a good quantitative match of the limiting
  bulk friction as long as similar initial packing density is achieved.%

  Powder shear testing has been used to assess flowability of powders for at
  least 48years [A.W. Jenike, Storage and Flow of Solids, Bull., Eng. Exp.
  Station, Univ. Utah, vol. 123, 1964]. A fundamental part of the data
  interpretation involves construction of Mohrs circles such that they are
  tangent to the experimental locus; a set of powder shear strengths, measured
  at variable applied compressive normal stresses. Despite the customary
  application of this tangency criterion, we have found justifications for it
  to be scant. In this work, we revisit the Mohrs circle construction and find
  that proper construction would require measurement of reactionary lateral
  powder stresses. We further provide reasoning to support placement of the
  experimental locus passing through the apex (top) of Mohrs circles for
  isotropic or orthotropic powders and not tangentially to them. This placement
  is not unexpectedly in agreement with the results of a recent numerical
  simulation [C. Thornton, L. Zhang, Numerical simulations of the direct shear
  test, Chem. Eng. Technol. 26 (2) (2003) 153-156], and reveals errors in
  subsequently calculated constants on the order of 20%.%

  The yield locus (YL) of powder bed can be used to determine many mechanical
  properties of a powder such as cohesion, unconfined yield stress, stress
  ratio, etc. Generally, the YL of powder beds is obtained by fitting the
  results of shear tests to linear approximations based on the Coulomb equation
  or to curved approximations based on the Warren-Spring equation. Meanwhile,
  the yielding characteristics of a powder bed are expressed by the Roscoe
  condition diagram. In this diagram, the YL appears orthogonal to the normal
  stress axis at both ends corresponding to tensile and compressive strength.
  However, the YL approximated by the Coulomb or Warren-Spring equations is not
  orthogonal to the normal stress axis at both ends, and is not the same shape
  as the YL shown in Roscoe condition diagrams. Thus, the abovementioned
  mechanical properties obtained from the YL of a powder bed are likely to be
  affected by the approximate expression for the YL. Despite this, no one has
  investigated how the mechanical properties of powder beds such as stress
  ratios are affected by the approximation method for the YL. In this paper, we
  propose a new approximation equation for the YL that conforms both to the
  shape of the YL in the Roscoe condition diagrams and experimental results.
  Then, these YL obtained by our equation, and by the Coulomb and Warren-Spring
  equations are used to determine the mechanical and flow properties of powder
  beds. These values are compared with each other in order to discuss the
  validity of our equation.%

  In this study 3D DEM-simulations of hopper discharge using non-cohesive,
  monodisperse spherical and polyhedral particles as well as particle shapes
  generated by the multi-sphere method are carried out. For this purpose an
  overview of the Common Plane algorithm for contact detection between
  polyhedral particles is given and an important refinement of the contact
  point definition is presented. In the hopper the effect of increasing
  particle angularity on the flow properties is investigated. Moreover, three
  different hopper designs are chosen, to further examine the influence of
  hopper angle and hopper opening size on the flow properties in combination
  with varying particle shapes. It is demonstrated that particles with an
  increasing angularity reduce the mass flow rate from the hopper and in case
  of the flat bottom hopper increase the residual quantity after discharge. In
  all simulations significant differences between polyhedral and clustered
  particles were observed, which indicates that the type of particle shape
  approximation is a parameter that has to be considered in DEM-simulations of
  hopper discharge.%

  Measured flowing densities of binary mixtures of equal-solids density
  near-spherical granules discharging from a hopper are correlated with static
  densities calculated using the linear-mixture packing model developed by Yu
  and Standish. This correlation is used in a modified form of the Beverloo
  equation to predict the rate of discharge of solid materials through a hopper
  orifice. The so-called empty annulus effect in the modified Beverloo equation
  is related to statistical mean particle sizes representing binary mixtures. A
  general equation is developed in two forms, the first is universal,
  encompassing both segregating and non-segregating systems, and the second is
  specific to non-segregating systems. They can be used to calculate hopper
  discharge rates for binary mixtures without need for experimental data. Both
  are found to correlate closely with experimentally measured discharge rates.%

  In this paper the Flexible Wall Biaxial Tester is introduced. The stresses
  and strains that can be applied to a sample are aligned along perpendicular
  axes, which makes the tester very suitable for fundamental investigation of
  powder flow. The stress state of powders at a free surface is characterized
  by the flow function. With this tester the unconfined yield strength can be
  measured in a single experiment, without extrapolation. The tester has been
  used to measure the flow function of the standard BCR-limestone powder. It is
  concluded that the flow function measured with the Jenike Tester is too low.
  A comparison with other measurements reported in the literature is made and
  the differences explained. A firm recommendation is made for a reliable

  Abstract The aim of the present study is to evaluate the new approach to
  dense particulate systems proposed by Jop et al. [1], in the dense regions of
  a High Shear Granulator (HSG). Wet granulation in high shear mixers is a
  common process in pharmaceutical technologies and a good understanding of the
  local mixing and flow patterns is a pre-requisite for this step. In the
  aforementioned model a dense granular flow is characterized as a
  visco-plastic fluid. Therefore the local rheology of the system can be
  predicted assuming averaged and virtual properties and a constant solid
  volume fraction. A simple disc impeller granulator with glass spheres was
  chosen for this study. The dynamics of the system have been studied using
  several techniques including PIV analyses, CFD simulation and image
  processing. The flow behaviour has been characterized for various impeller
  speeds and particle loads. Several cases have been analyzed from different
  aspects both in experiments and through equivalent simulations to evaluate
  the validity of the model in these particular applications. Results look
  promising in spite of the simplicity of the model. The model was found to
  give a good general description of the flow field and bed shape. On the other
  hand the model is insufficient in some aspects; mostly related to the regions
  with low volume fraction. The next step would be to combine the model with
  conventional models on rapid granular flow such as Kinetic Theory of Granular
  Flows (KTGF).%

  Accurate measurements have been made of the impact and rebound behaviour of
  5mm aluminium oxide spheres impacting a thick sodalime glass anvil, for
  impact angles from normal to very near glancing incidence. Speed, angle and
  rotation before and after impact have been measured with a strobe and
  singleframe digital camera. Reproducibility and precision are considerably
  better than in any previously published work, and have been achieved by
  careful attention to all aspects of the experiment, including the mechanical
  and optical systems, illumination, electronic control, computer-based image
  measurement, and the geometry and condition of the impacting surfaces. All
  aspects of the rebound dynamics of the elastic spheres, including the motion
  of the centre of mass and of the contact patch, the spin and the partition of
  energy, are fully described by the measured variation of the normal and
  tangential restitution coefficients over the range of impact angles. These
  measurements show very close agreement with the numerical work of Maw et al.
  which takes into account the effects of sticking, microslip and tangential
  compliance. For impacts with a greater obliqueness than about 30 from the
  normal, the results also agree closely with the classical theory of rigid
  body sliding.%

  Abstract We present a simple model for the hydrodynamic drag force acting on
  the individual N particles of aggregates in uniform flow with low Reynolds
  number. The present model predicts the shielding effect due to hydrodynamic
  interactions by considering the individual location and flow direction. The
  shielding effect of two particles was obtained from curve fitting with the
  exact solution. Furthermore, the shielding effect of N-particles was extended
  using scaling laws and curve fitting equations. The present model is
  advantageous in that it can predict the drag force without considering the
  fractal dimension. In addition, the hydrodynamic interaction between
  particles can be calculated without matrix operations. The presented model
  was verified by calculating the drag acting on aggregates with the Filippov
  method. Verification conditions were that the number of particles was less
  than 200, and the fractal dimension was in the range of 1.3 to 2.6.
  Validation results showed good agreement with Filippov's exact solution. The
  maximum error for the total drag force is within 5 \%. Finally, we not only
  applied the drag force model to the discrete element method, but also
  performed a numerical study of gravitational sedimentation problems at fixed
  depth.%

  Abstract In the design of a storage silo usually an axially symmetric state
  of stress is assumed. However, unsymmetrical pressure distribution may occur
  because of such factors as: non-uniform humidity of the material, eccentric
  filling or/and discharge, and additional construction elements inside the
  deposit. Small internal construction members act similarly to structural
  imperfection and can initiate buckling, while larger flow obstacles can
  markedly alter the stress distribution. A study was conducted to numerically
  simulate the effect of plane (2D) or block (3D) obstruction attached to the
  wall in a model grain silo holding wheat. This work compares the results of
  earlier laboratory testing and numerical simulations using the discrete
  element method (DEM). Series of the DEM simulations were performed with an
  assembly of 75000 spherical particles with random uniform distribution of
  diameters with a mean of 3.8 mm and range of +-1\% placed in the cylindrical
  container with a diameter of 0.12 m. The set-up of DEM simulations reproduced
  earlier laboratory tests performed in the model grain silo, 1.83 m in
  diameter with flat floor and corrugated wall. Despite the very large
  difference in the number of particles in real and simulated deposits, the
  results of simulations and laboratory testing were in fairly good agreement.%

  Many characterization techniques are available to determine the flow
  properties of powders; however, it is debated which method(s) are the most
  appropriate. In this study, sample fine powders with a medium particle size
  between 22 and 31 microm were characterized using a variety of techniques
  that tested powders under different stress states, ranging from static to
  dynamic. It was found that characterization techniques that were more dynamic
  such as fluidized bed expansion were best suited for predicting the
  fluidization performance while characterization techniques that were more
  static such as cohesion were better for predicting agglomeration. It was also
  found that results from static and dynamic characterization do not
  necessarily agree, where fine powders that showed good fluidization
  performance also displayed increased agglomeration, and vice versa. This
  suggests that flow properties are dependent upon the stress state and that no
  single technique is suitable for the full characterization of a powder. In
  other words, both static and dynamic characterization techniques must be
  employed to completely understand the flow properties of a powder and predict
  how it will behave under different process conditions.%

  This is an experimental and numerical study of dry, frictional powder flows
  in the quasi-static and intermediate regimes using the geometry of the
  Couette device. We measure normal and shear stresses on the shearing surface
  and extract from the data, constitutive equations valid in the slow
  frictional, quasi-static and the intermediate (dense), collisional regimes of
  flow. This constitutive equation is then used in a new, specially developed
  FEM solver (FeatFlow-Ouazzi et al., 2005 [18]) to obtain solutions of the
  continuum equations of motion as well as stress and velocity distributions in
  the powder. While the measurements to obtain the constitutive equation are
  performed in a concentric Couette device, the numerical scheme is used to
  predict the torque and stresses in two additional geometries. These
  geometries are an eccentric Couette where the inner, rotating cylinder is
  placed off-center with different eccentricities and a more complicated
  geometry where a cylindrical body is introduced in the middle between the
  rotating and stationary cylinders and obstructs part of the shearing gap. The
  purpose of these calculations is to show the versatility of the numerical
  solution.%

  The aim of this study is develop a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron neural
  network (MLPNN) model to predict the solid solubilities of aromatic
  hydrocarbons, aliphatic carboxylic acids, aromatic acids, heavy aliphatic and
  aromatic alcohols in the supercritical carbon dioxide. Different networks are
  considered and trained using 627 data sets; the accuracy of the network is
  validated by 343 testing data sets. The networks were different regarding to
  network parameters, such as number of hidden layer, hidden neurons and
  training algorithm. Using validating data set, the network that is having the
  lowest absolute average relative deviation percent (AARD%), mean square error
  (MSE) and the highest regression coefficient (R2) is selected as an optimal
  configuration. To verify the network generalization, 100 different data sets
  of 23 binary systems have been considered. In the present work, 970
  experimental data points of different works (up to now) which covers a wide
  range of temperatures and pressures have been used. Statistical analyses show
  that the artificial neural network (ANN) predictions have an excellent
  agreement (AARD%=0.98, MSE=2.8*10-5 and R2=0.99813) with the experimental
  data set. Also, accuracy of the cubic Peng-Robinson (PR) and
  Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations of state by using six mixing rules,
  namely, the Wong-Sandler (WS) rule, the Orbey-Sandler (OS) rule, the van der
  Waals one fluid rule with one (VDW1) and two (VDW2) adjustable parameters,
  the covolume dependent (CVD) rule and the Esmaeilzadeh-As-adi-Lashkarbolooki
  (EAL) mixing rule for the prediction of solubility of solids in supercritical
  carbon dioxide has been compared with a developed neural network model. To
  base this comparison on a fair basis, same experimental data points of 23
  different compounds has been used for both optimization of equations of state
  parameters and training, validation and testing of neural network. Results
  show that developed optimal ANN model is more accurate compared to the PR and
  SRK EOSs with mentioned mixing rules for the same compounds.%

  A series of physical rock flow experiments have been conducted in a chute in
  the laboratory to simulate the rock flow that occurs in the chamber of a cone
  crusher. Discrete element modeling (DEM) has been subsequently used to model
  the granular flow experiments. The DEM models were validated against the
  velocity profiles obtained from the laboratory experiments performed. To
  simulate the rock flow, pebbles of different sizes were used in the
  experiments and simulated using clumps of overlapping spheres in the
  simulations. It was found that the method of deposition of the pebbles into
  the chute is important to the DEM simulation of the flow of the non-spherical
  particles. The validated DEM models were used to investigate the relationship
  between the chute aggregate clearance times, the chute closed-size setting
  (CSS) and the bite angle. An analysis of both the experimental and DEM
  studies concluded that both an increase in the bite angle and a decrease in
  CSS resulted in an increase in the chute clearance times. Moreover, for a
  constant bite angle, there are two critical CSS values, which depend on the
  sizes of particles: one which allows pebbles to flow and the other which
  results in a minimum clearance time.%

  A granular material is a complex system which exhibits non-trivial
  transitions between the static, the quasi-static and the dynamical states.
  Indeed, an assembly of grains can behave like a solid or a fluid according to
  the applied stress. In between solid and fluid granular states, very slow
  dynamics are observed. When a complete macroscopic characterization of a
  powder is needed, all these granular states have to be precisely analyzed. In
  this paper, we show how three measurement techniques can be used to measure
  the physical properties of a powder. The measurements are based on classical
  tests modified to meet the recent fundamental researches on granular
  materials. The static properties of the powder are analyzed through the shape
  of a heap. The quasi-static behavior is studied with the analysis of the
  compaction dynamics. Finally, the dynamical regime is monitored through the
  flow in a rotating drum. In order to illustrate how these measurements can be
  used in practical cases, analyses are performed with three types of granular
  materials: silicon carbide abrasives, flours and rice. These selected
  materials allow to show the influence of the different parameters (grain
  size, grain size distribution, grain shape) on the macroscopic properties of
  the assembly. Moreover, these studies show the pertinence of the parameters
  obtained with the proposed techniques for the rheological characterization of
  powders and grains.%

  Instantaneous flow properties of fine cohesive powders, i.e. limestone,
  glass-ballotini, alumina and talc, are evaluated using Jenike shear tester.
  The results are analysed in the light of elastic-plastic interparticle
  contact deformation theory incorporating fundamentals of fine powder adhesion
  and consolidation in flow behavior characterization. Thus, unconfined yield
  strengths of the given samples at various consolidation levels are evaluated
  solely on the basis of material characteristic parameters, i.e. angle of
  internal friction, stationary angle of friction, isostatic tensile strength
  of an unconsolidated powder Â along with characteristic pre-consolidation
  influence and subsequently predicted flow functions are compared with those
  evaluated experimentally. The correlation coefficient values for the
  comparison are found to be in the range of 0.96-0.99, indicating the
  satisfactory nature of the above parameters in explaining the flow behavior.
  Further, compressibility indices and elastic-plastic contact consolidation
  coefficient (K) characterizing powder cohesiveness are calculated using

  Abstract The flow properties of bulk materials are influenced by particle
  shape and particle size, amongst others. Often the particle shape is assumed
  to be less important in literature. As yet, almost no results are available
  on the effect of particle shape on the flowability of crushed grain products.
  Therefore, two test series were performed with two different particle size
  fractions in the range of 0.2mm. To evaluate the flow properties of the
  particles, the flowability according to Jenike was applied. In the first test
  series, the flowability was determined by using a Walker shear cell, and in
  the second test series by means of a translation shear cell according to
  Jenike. The particle shape was characterized by the ratio of particle length
  to particle width (elongation) as well as by the fractionary dimension. As
  the measurements revealed, the flowability of the crushed grain decreased the
  more the particle shape deviated from the spherical shape and the roughness
  of the particle surface increased. As the elongation increased, the tensile
  strength of both particle size fractions increased and the flowability
  decreased in the first test series. The same behaviour was observed in the
  second test series where the fractionary dimension was increased.%

  The discrete element method (DEM) is a proven numerical technique for
  modelling the multibody collision behavior of particulate systems. This
  method is used here to study the motion of ball charge in tumbling mills. To
  get meaningful results, it is essential that the parameters involved in the
  model be carefully determined. These parameters embody essentially the
  material properties of the system: stiffness, damping, and friction. In this
  study, all the parameters are carefully determined experimentally for
  different operating mill conditions. A computer code based on DEM has been
  developed to model the motion of the balls in tumbling mills. The code
  incorporates a scheme to calculate the applied torque, and hence power input
  to the mill. A 55-cm ball mill is simulated for two different liner
  cross-sectionsâ€” rectangular and triangular. Results of the simulations
  pertaining to applied torque are compared with the experiments. It is found
  that, with a particular model for the coefficient of friction, the predicted
  torque agrees well with the experiments.%

  Abstract The vertical granular drag force on objects held stationary in a
  moving bed of nickel pellets with diameters in the range 1-10mm has been
  measured and compared with Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations.
  Experiments were carried out with horizontal wooden rods, and horizontal and
  vertical thin plates made of mild steel or Teflon. The experimental data are
  correlated by semi-empirical equations based on the supported mass of pellets
  in the region above the object, and dynamic friction coefficients acting on
  vertical surfaces from least-squares regression. Dynamic coefficients of
  friction for nickel on steel and nickel on Teflon are reported. The
  correlation is compared with an expression based on Janssen's equation using
  the experimentally determined coefficients of friction. These results are
  compared with DEM simulations, which examine the effects of particle size
  distribution, mass flow rate, plate friction coefficient mi and the
  simulation parameter K1, which is analogous to a spring constant. The
  correlation follows the trends of the data and the DEM results agree well
  with the experimental data over a wide range of conditions. The DEM
  simulations were carried out on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) that enabled
  a speed-up factor of 40, and some aspects of the implementation on GPUs are
  discussed.%

  Abstract The three phase contact angle between liquids and fine solids is a
  key design parameter used in the control of the mineral separation, foam
  stabilisation or antifoaming processes, and therefore the accurate
  determination of is critical. Commonly used techniques produce variable
  results and are sensitive to the liquid type or viscosity. Different size
  ranges of non-porous, spherical glass beads were used to determine the
  applicability of the sessile drop method on particles forming flat surfaces
  using different adhesives. Also investigated were the capillary rise and thin
  layer wicking techniques for the measurements of the contact angle between
  particles and water or oils of variable viscosity. The measured contact
  angles between particles and all liquids were compared with the contact
  angles obtained on the flat glass, made of the same material as the
  particles. Additionally, some of the particles were chemically modified in
  order to produce variable range of particle hydrophobicity for further
  comparison of the technique applicability. The measured contact angles were
  also qualitatively verified with the particle attachment to the bubble formed
  in the investigated liquids. Very good agreement between the measured water
  contact angles on particles using the sessile drop method and the water
  contact angles measured on flat glass was found for both degrees of glass
  hydrophobicity. The water contact angles measured of the particles with the
  capillary rise and thin layer wicking methods were found to be consistently
  larger, although reliable if considered as advancing contact angles. The
  contact angles between particles and three different viscosity oils were
  measured correctly only with the sessile drop method. By comparison, the thin
  layer wicking and the capillary rise technique produced significant errors.
  To conclude, the sessile drop on the adhesive slide is the most accurate
  technique for the measurements of contact angles between particles and water
  or oils, demonstrating that the technique is independent of the particle size
  or degree of hydrophobicity.%

  A PhD project titled: Direct on-line measurement of wall friction of coal as
  an indicator of handleability, and sponsored by Corus plc., has arisen from a
  need to obtain real time information about the flow-ability of the coal, so
  troublesome batches can be detected before problems arise. The on-line wall
  friction tester essentially comprises a skid plate that rest on the top free
  surface of a bulk solid being transported on a conveyor belt. The skid plate
  is connected to a load cell via a drag link allowing the shear force between
  the skid plate and bulk solid to be sensed as the latter is conveyed. This
  paper presents results comparing the on-line tester to the Jenike wall
  friction tester for two different bulk solids namely: crushed glass and coal.
  The effect of velocity on the on-line tester has also been studied.%

  The granular flow behavior of carbon nanotubes produced by the CCVD method in
  a laboratory continuous inclined rotary reactor and of a catalyst was
  experimentally studied using a rotating drum. The dynamic angle of repose of
  the bulk solid and the standard variation of the solid bed surface were
  determined as a function of rotational speed of the rotating drum and for
  several filling percentages of the drum. Whatever the carbon nanotube
  production conditions, the dynamic angle of repose and the standard variation
  of the solid bed depended only on the filling percentage of the drum. Results
  were very interesting for practical application to carbon nanotube production
  in an industrial continuous inclined rotary reactor, because the granular
  flow behavior was the same during the reaction throughout the length of the
  reactor and depended only on the reactor filling. A bed behavior diagram
  based on the drum rotational speed and on the drum filling percentage was
  also constructed experimentally. The flow behavior of the solid during carbon
  nanotube production was on the boundary between the slumping and the rolling
  modes, leading to a good mixing of gas and solid during the reaction and to
  an improvement of the mass and heat transfer in the bed.%

  Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The
  first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each
  a fixed subset of interatomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a
  fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics
  models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently those with
  shortrange forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can
  be implemented on any distributedmemory parallel machine which allows for
  messagepassing of data between independently executing processors. The
  algorithms are tested on a standard LennardJones benchmark problem for system
  sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel
  supercomputers the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D.
  Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray YMP and C90
  algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is
  competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems.
  For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of
  90 and a 1840node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray
  C90 processor. Tradeoffs between the three algorithms and guidelines for
  adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also
  discussed.%

  A novel particle tracking velocimetry (PTV)/computational fluid dynamics
  (CFD) hybrid method for measuring coefficient of restitution (COR) has been
  developed which is relatively simple, cost-effective, and robust. A laser and
  camera system is used in the Virginia Tech Aerothermal Rig to measure
  velocity trajectories of microparticles. The method solves for particle
  impact velocity at the impact surface using a CFD solution and Lagrangian
  particle tracking. The methodology presented here attempts to characterize a
  difficult problem by a combination of established techniques, PTV and CFD,
  which have not been used in this capacity before. Erosion and deposition are
  functions of particle/wall interactions and COR is a fundamental property of
  these interactions. COR depends on impact velocity, angle of impact,
  temperature, particle composition, and wall material. Two sizes of Arizona
  road dust and one size of glass beads are impacted on to a 304 stainless
  steel coupon. Mean results collected using this new technique compare
  favorably with trends established in literature. The utilization of this
  technique to measure COR of microparticle sand will help develop a
  computational model and serve as a baseline for further measurements at
  elevated air and wall temperatures.%

  A new method and equipment for the determination of the vertical tensile
  strength of bulk solids is described. It allows for the direct determination
  of the tensile strength of compacted as well as of almost noncompacted
  powders. For the experiments lactose and corn starch were used as model
  substances. The cohesion of a powder determined by means of the Jenike shear
  cell and the tensile strength measured using the new tensile strength tester
  (TST) were compared. The influence of the powder porosity on the tensile
  strength and cohesion, respectively was also investigated. As expected the
  tensile strengths determined by means of the TST are lower than the cohesions
  obtained from shear cell measurements. However, the ratio of the cohesions of
  lactose and corn starch determined by using the shear cell is the same as
  that calculated from results obtained by means of the TST. The results
  obtained from the Jenike shear cell are much more sensitive to the sample
  porosity than those from the TST. This observation can be explained by the
  different measuring principles. In contrast to the TST, the Jenike shear cell
  method requires that the powders have to be consolidated to a certain state.
  The new equipment however allows for the determination of the vertical
  tensile strengths of noncompacted powders.%

  The Discrete Element Method (DEM) can help to obtain detailed information on
  the mixing process within a bed of fuel particles on grate firing systems. In
  a first study it was shown by comparing experiments on a generic grate with
  DEM simulations that for a granulate consisting of monodisperse spheres the
  influence of grate stroke length and bar velocity can be reproduced. Prior to
  tackling particle assemblies which are polydisperse and consist of particles
  of complex shape it has to be shown that the influence of particle diameter
  and material properties of the particles is described correctly by DEM
  simulations. Thus experiments with monodisperse spheres of three different
  diameters (5, 10, 20Â mm) and two materials (plastic, wood) are compared to
  DEM simulations. The mixing process is measured at the front side wall and at
  the top surface of the particle bed and quantified by image analysis. Both
  visual observation and mixing parameter results attest a very good agreement
  between experiments and simulations. The influence of particle diameter and
  material properties measured in the experiments can be reproduced by DEM
  simulations.%

  The atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to investigate the interaction
  forces between individual particles qualitatively as well as quantitatively.
  Lactose as a typical excipient for solid drugs was chosen as model substance.
  The interaction forces were determined between a single particle of
  crystalline lactose and a tablet of lactose. Their surface topography was
  characterized by AFM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to allow
  a quantitative assessment of the surface roughness and its influence on the
  measured forces. To analyze the representative surface segments, the minimum
  and maximum surface roughness of the lactose tablet is determined in
  dependence of the segment size. The contact area between the tablet and the
  particle of lactose was quantified by the tip estimation of Villarrubia.
  Interparticle forces were measured with force volume scans. They allow the
  determination of the three-dimensional surface structure and, simultaneously,
  a defined number of force curves in regular distances is taken.%

  Granular flow of three granular flow experiments is predicted by a
  computational particle fluid dynamic CPFD numerical scheme in three dimension
  using the true particle size distribution. The experiments are simple which
  show the characteristics of particle flow which differs from fluid flow. The
  experiments are flow of particles in sedimentation, a U-tube and from a
  hopper. The CPFD method models the fluid as a fluid and models the particles
  as discrete particles (material description). The CPFD method is a form of
  discrete element method, where each particle has three-dimensional forces
  from fluid drag, gravity, staticâ€“dynamic friction, particle collision
  and possibly other forces. However, unlike DEM models which calculate
  particle-to-particle force by a springâ€“damper model and direct
  particle contact, the CPFD method models collision force on each particle as
  a spatial gradient. The CPFD numerical method predictions compare well with
  all three experiments with no adjustment of parameters or empirical
  correlations between calculations.%

  Abstract We present theoretical predictions of granular flow in a conical
  hopper based on a continuum theory employing a recently developed
  constitutive model with microstructure evolution by Sun and Sundaresan [1].
  The model is developed for strain rate-independent granular flows. The
  closures for the pressure and the macroscopic friction coefficient are linked
  to microstructure through evolution equations for the coordination number and
  fabric. The material constants in the model are functions of particle-level
  properties. A salient prediction is the variable stress ratio along the flow
  direction, in contrast to the constant ratio employed in some widely used
  plasticity theories, but supported by results obtained from discrete element
  simulations. The model permits direct interrogation of the influence of
  particleparticle friction as well as normal-stress differences on the stress
  distribution and discharge rate. Increasing particle friction leads to higher
  stress ratios, but lower normal stress and flow rates, while considering
  normal-stress differences results in the opposite effects.%

  The Rankine coefficient is the ratio of the vertical pressure (maximum
  principal stress) and horizontal pressure (minimum principal stress) acting
  on a powder bed. The value of the Rankine coefficient is usually determined
  from the yield locus, which comes from the shear test results either by
  linear approximation using the Coulomb equation or by curve fitting using the
  WarrenSpring equation. Since the shape of the yield locus is obtained by
  approximation, the Rankine coefficient might change with the estimation
  method. The Rankine coefficient is an important coefficient for estimating
  the pressure distribution in a powder bed. However, no studies about the
  effect of the yield locus estimation method on the Rankine coefficient can be
  found in the past literature. In this paper, first we study the effect of
  three approximations, i.e. the Coulomb equation, the WarrenSpring equation
  and an equation proposed by the authors, on the Rankine coefficient. Based on
  these results, we investigate how the selection of the yield locus estimation
  method affects the Rankine coefficient. Then we compare the Rankine
  coefficients obtained from consolidation tests and from each of these yield
  loci, thereby demonstrating the validity of our proposed approximation
  equation.%

  Chemical and mechanical engineers are quite familiar with concepts of fluid
  flow which include mass and momentum balances and constitutive equations
  which contain such material characteristics as viscosity and density.
  Combination of the above correlations yields the well-known Navier-Stokes
  equations which have to be solved to obtain details of the flow field; a
  large number of analytical solutions of these equations exist. Somewhat
  similar equations have been developed for granular materials moving in the
  rapid granular flow regime, i.e. in the regime in which particle-particle
  contacts are not very extensive and hence friction is not prevalent. These
  equations result from a similarity between the movement of molecules and the
  flow of small elastic (or elasto-plastic) particles and resemble, for certain
  limiting cases, the fluid flow equations. Slow, frictional flows of powders
  are different in that particles are in contact for extended periods of time
  and friction is the overwhelming interaction. Flow in this regime is governed
  by the same mass and momentum balances but the constitutive equations are
  different. Only very recently have some of these equations been combined to
  yield a set of differential equations which take the place of the
  Navier-Stokes equations; only very few solutions of these equations exist.
  The present paper describes common features and major dissimilarities between
  different equations of motion for the above systems and some of their
  solutions and presents examples and comparisons of powder and fluid flows in
  identical geometries. Furthermore, general equations of motion for
  compressible powders in slow flow are developed and an example of an
  analytical solution is given.%

  High-energy milling is considered to be one of the most efficient techniques
  for producing materials that have a well-controlled chemical composition and
  microstructural features that are difficult to obtain using other synthesis
  routes. In this study, the mechanical alloying technique (MA) was used to
  develop special powder metallurgy (PM) steels with two different types of
  properties. The use of this technique is essential for obtaining the target
  microstructure, which ensures the desired performance of the resulting
  material. Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels were produced
  using MA based on the prealloyed grade steels with the addition of Ti as
  reinforcements. The incorporation of Ti enables a homogeneous dispersion of
  nano-oxides and nano-clusters in a submicron-grained structure that should
  enhance the mechanical properties up to 600. In addition, the base alloying
  system, should enable the development of protective oxide layers through
  high-temperature treatments, which improves the compatibility with the
  environment, avoids liquidmetal embrittlement and contributes to the increase
  of the mechanical response up to 600. Furthermore, microalloyed powders can
  be obtained using MA and consolidated with a pressure-assisted sintering
  process in an attempt to control the final grain size, to achieve
  microalloyed steels, and to achieve an extraordinary balance of properties.%

  Abstract This paper presents the best artificial neural network (ANN) model
  for the estimation of the convective heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of
  nanofluids flowing through a circular tube with various wall conditions under
  different flow regimes. The parameters of the ANN model are adjusted by the
  back propagation learning algorithm using wide ranges of experimental
  datasets. The developed ANN model shows mean square error (MSE) of 1.7 x
  10^-5, absolute average relative deviation, percent (AARD \%) of 2.41 and
  regression coefficient (R2) of 0.99966 in modeling of overall experimental
  datasets of convective HTC. The predictive performance of the proposed
  approach is compared with some reliable correlations which have been proposed
  in various literatures. The superior performance of the proposed model with
  respect to other published works has been found through the comparison of
  results.%

  Abstract In the present study artificial neural network (ANN) approach was
  used for the prediction of effect of physical and mechanical properties of
  Al2024-B4C composites produced by powder metallurgy. Effects of reinforcement
  size and content (wt.%) on the physical and mechanical properties of
  composites were determined by measuring the density, hardness and tensile
  strength values. Density, hardness and tensile values strength of the
  composites were the outputs obtained from the proposed ANN. It was found that
  the effect of reinforcement size and content on the homogeneous distribution
  of B4C particles is as important as the effect of milling time. By comparing
  the predicted values with the experimental data, it was demonstrated that the
  well-trained feed forward back propagation ANN model is a powerful tool for
  prediction of effect of physical and mechanical properties of composites.%

  Abstract In order to confirm reliable particle size measurement technique and
  to prepare standard reference particles for calibrating particle size
  measurement devices, uncertainty region of count and mass based size
  distribution have been theoretically examined. The uncertainty region of
  count base cumulative size distribution is smaller than that of the mass base
  cumulative distribution. The uncertainty region of count base cumulative size
  distribution is nearly constant over wide range of particle diameter and the
  region is nearly constant for sample size greater than about 20,000. On the
  other hand, the uncertainty region of mass base cumulative distribution
  increases with the increase of particle diameter. The reliability of
  theoretical uncertainty region is confirmed by the experimental data of
  particle size measurement.%

  This paper presents a numerical and experimental study of the angle of repose
  of mono-sized coarse spheres, a most important macroscopic parameter in
  characterising granular materials. Numerical experiments are conducted by
  means of a modified discrete element method. Emphasis is given to the effects
  of variables related to factors such as particle characteristics, material
  properties and geometrical constraints. The results show that under the
  present simulation conditions, the angle of repose is significantly affected
  by the sliding and rolling frictions, particle size and container thickness,
  and is not sensitive to density, Poisson's ratio, damping coefficient and
  Young's modulus. Increasing rolling or sliding friction coefficient increases
  the angle of repose, while increasing particle size or container thickness
  decreases the angle of repose. Based on the numerical results, empirical
  equations are formulated for engineering application. The proposed simulation
  technique and equations are validated by comparing the physical and numerical
  experiments, where focus is given to the effects of particle size and
  container thickness.%
