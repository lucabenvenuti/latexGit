After the experimental characterization with a $SRSCT$ and an $AOR$ tester we performed a 
limited number of $DEM$ simulations designed to be representative of the experiments. 
By varying a selection of the $DEM$ parameters combinations we obtained different numerical bulk behaviours. 
We used these numerical results to train $NN$. Once trained, they processed huge 
numbers of $DEM$ parameters combinations to fast collect their numerical bulk behaviours. 
The latters were compared with the experimental values to gather valid
combinations. \\
