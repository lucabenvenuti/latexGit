\caption[Experimental stress path]{Sample of the experimental stress path for
the Schulze ring shear cell tester.
In the first 300 seconds the $\sigma_n = 2000 ~[Pa]$ is kept constant. After 250
seconds a plateau is reached.
The $\mu_{psh}$ is calculated as average of the $\mu_{ie}$ in this plateau.
Later, the $\sigma_n$ is reduced to $80 \%$ of its initial value.
After approximately 30 seconds, a second plateau starts.
As average of $\mu_{ie}$ in this second plateau we obtain $\mu_{sh}$.
