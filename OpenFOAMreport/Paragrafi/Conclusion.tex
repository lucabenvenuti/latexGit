The modellization of the temperature variation of a densely packed bed 
has been performed with OpenFOAM\textregistered.\\
We established the domain, the regions (air, porous), and the probes
to replicate the experimental setup.
Later, we varied the permeability coefficient and the flow speed boundary
condition to identify their effect on the temperature variations.
Finally, we fixed the permeability coefficient and we identified the most
suitable value for the flow speed to match the experimental results.\\
We could then claim that this simulation tool was effective to analyze the
problem at hand.
