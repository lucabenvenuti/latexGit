simulation]{Comparison between prediction of the trained Neural Network ($NN$)
and 546 full DEM simulations of the coefficient of pre-shear ($\mu_{psh}$). In
this case the regression line is nearly linear, and demonstrates the accurate

% Regression plot - $\mu_{psh}$. In this case the
% $Output = 0.96 \cdot Target + 0.046$. With 546 simulations the $R^2 = 0.98044$. The plot
% presents a consistent agreement between the $DEM$ results distribution and the $NN$ regression line.
