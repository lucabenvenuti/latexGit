	abstract={Particulate systems are of interest in many disciplines. They are often investigated using the discrete element method because of its capability to investigate particulate systems at the individual particle scale. To model the interaction between two particles and between a particle and a boundary, conventional discrete element models use springs and dampers in both the normal and tangential directions. The significance of particle rotation has been highlighted in both numerical studies and physical experiments. Several researchers have attempted to incorporate a rotational torque to account for the rolling resistance or rolling friction by developing different models. This paper presents a review of the commonly used models for rolling resistance and proposes a more general model. These models are classified into four categories according to their key characteristics. The robustness of these models in reproducing rolling resistance effects arising from different physical situations was assessed by using several benchmarking test cases. The proposed model can be seen to be more general and suitable for modelling problems involving both dynamic and pseudo-static regimes. An example simulation of the formation of a 2D sandpile is also shown. For simplicity, all formulations and examples are presented in 2D form, though the general conclusions are also applicable to 3D systems.},

	pages={335-342},
	abstract={The flow behaviour of very dense particle regimes such as in a moving or fluidized bed is highly dependent on the inter-particle friction, which can be characterized by the coefficient of friction. Since only rough guide values for common material pairs are available in the literature, we determine the exact parameters by fitting numerical simulations to experimental measurements of a simplified Jenike shear tester.  The open-source discrete-element-method code LIGGGHTS is used to model the shear cell, which is built of triangulated meshes. In order to preload the bulk solid in the shear cell with a constant principal stress, the movement of these walls is controlled by a prescribed load.  A comprehensive sensitivity study shows that the results are nearly insensitive to the spatial dimensions of the shear tester as well as all other material properties. Therefore, this set-up is applicable to determine the coefficient of friction.  Furthermore, we calculate the coefficient of friction of glass beads showing very good agreement with literature data and in-house experiments. Hence, this procedure can be used to deduce material parameters for the numerical simulation of dense granular flows.}

	abstract={Abstract Studying the flow of granular materials is important for its impact on both industrial applications and natural phenomena. A fundamental understanding of the flow of granular materials is lacking, and this results in difficulties in modeling and predicting their flow behavior. The discrete element method (DEM) is often used as the  gold standard both for predicting the results of experiments as well as for comparison to continuumlevel theories of granular material flows due to its derivation from first-principal constructs, like contact mechanics. In this paper, we continue our work on quantitative validation of DEM simulations using detailed measurements of simple, well-characterized flows that allow us to examine the effect of rough surfaces and rotational rates on granular flow using an annular shear cell. Experimentally, we use digital particle tracking velocimetry (DPTV) to obtain velocity, solids fraction, and granular temperature profiles. Computationally, we compare the results obtained using different contact mechanics force laws to those from experimental measurements as well as perform a sensitivity analysis on device and particle geometry and different material properties employed. In previous work on stainless steel beads, we have found that an elasto-plastic normal force model is critical to obtaining accurate results as is detailed matching of both particle and system geometry, while the choice of friction model is found to be unimportant. Here, we examine the robustness of these observations to both particle materials properties as well as systemic variables (such as total system solids fraction). We find that the choice of frictional force model has little effect across all the profiles and all models, while the accuracy of the normal force model is material-dependent.},

	abstract={A hybrid neural network model is designed to predict the micro-macroscopic characteristics of particulate systems subjected to shearing. The network is initially trained to understand the micro-mechanical characteristics of particulate assemblies, by feeding the results based on three-dimensional discrete element simulations. Given the physical properties of the individual particles and the packing condition of the particulate assemblies under specified loading conditions, the network thus understands the way contact forces are distributed, the orientation of contact (fabric) networks and the evolution of stress tensor during the mechanical loading. These relationships are regarded as soft sensors. Using the signals received from soft sensors, a mechanistic neural network model is constructed to establish the relationship between the micro-macroscopic characteristics of granular assemblies subjected to shearing. The macroscopic results obtained form this hybrid mechanistic neural network modelling for data that were not part of the training signals, is compared with simulations based on discrete element modelling alone and in general, the agreement is good. The hybrid network responds to their inputs at a high speed and can be regarded as a real-time system for understanding the complex behaviour of particulate systems under mechanical process conditions.},

	journal={Chemical Engineering Science},
	number={0},
	abstract={Abstract Wet granulation is a particle design process, often used in the pharmaceutical, consumer product, food, and fertilizer industries. A better process understanding is needed to improve process design, control, and optimization. Predominantly, two modeling frameworks are implemented to simulate granulation processes: population balance modeling (PBM) and discrete element methods (DEM). While PBM simulates changes in the number of particles in each size class due to rate processes such as aggregation, DEM tracks each particle individually, with the abilities to simulate spatial variations and collect mechanistic data. In this bi-directional coupled approach, the computational expenditure of the full model is overwhelmed by the high-fidelity DEM algorithm that needs to solve a set of ODEs for each and every particle being handled in the system for very small time intervals. To mitigate this computational inefficiency, reduced order modeling (ROM) is used to replace the computationally expensive DEM step. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained using DEM results to relate particle size, size distribution, and impeller speed to the collision frequency. Results showed a high correlation between the trained ANN predictions and DEM-generated data. The ANN was coupled with a PBM as a key component of the aggregation rate kernel. The coupled model showed a different development of average particle size and size distribution over time from that of a constant aggregation rate kernel. In addition, the coupled model demonstrated sensitivity to the impeller speed via the ANN rate kernel. When compared with the fully coupled PBM-DEM model for accuracy and computation time savings, the hybrid PBM-ANN model demonstrated excellent agreement with DEM simulations at fractions of the original computational time.},

	abstract={An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed for modeling the effect of the amount of a process control agent (PCA) on the apparent density, particle size and microhardness of Al-10 wt.%Al2O3 composite powders. Methanol was used as the process control agent in varying amounts of 1, 2, and 3wt.% to investigate the effect of the PCA on the properties of the composite powders. Composite powders were fabricated using high energy planetary ball milling, and the training data for the ANN were collected from experimental results. After the training process, the experimental data were used to verify the accuracy of the system. The properties of the composite powders were analyzed using a hall flowmeter for the apparent density, a laser particle size analyzer for the particle size, a microhardness tester for the powder microhardness and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the powder morphology. The two input parameters in the proposed ANN were the amount of methanol and duration of the milling process. Apparent density, particle size and microhardness of the composite powders were the outputs obtained from the proposed ANN. As a result of this study the ANN was found to be successful for predicting the apparent density, particle size and microhardness of Al–Al2O3 composite powders. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the predicted values didn't exceed 4.93%. This model can be used for predicting Al-Al2O3 composite powder properties produced with different amounts of methanol and using different milling times.},

	volume={26},
	number={2},
	pages={89-111},
	abstract={While the discrete element method (DEM) is attracting increasing interest for the simulation of industrial granular flow, much of the previous DEM modelling has considered two-dimensional (2D) flows and used circular particles. The inclusion of particle shape into DEM models is very important and allows many flow features, particularly in hoppers, to be more accurately reproduced than was possible when using only circular particles. Elongated particles are shown here to produce flow rates up to 30% lower than for circular particles and give flow patterns that are quite different. The yielding of the particle microstructure resembles more the tearing of a continuum solid, with large-scale quasi-stable voids being formed and large groups of particles moving together. The flow becomes increasingly concentrated in a relatively narrow funnel above the hopper opening. This encourages the hope that DEM may be able to predict important problems such as bridging and rat-holing. Increasing the blockiness or angularity of the particles is also shown to increase resistance to flow and reduces the flow rates by up to 28%, but without having perceptible effect on the nature of the flow. We also describe our methodology for constructing and modelling geometrically complex industrial applications in three dimensions and present a series of industrially important three-dimensional (3D) case studies. The charge motion in a 5 m diameter ball mill and in a Hicom nutating mill, discharge from single- and four-port cylindrical hoppers, and particle size separation by a vibrating screen are demonstrated. For each case, plausible particle size distributions (PSDs) have been used. The results obtained indicate that DEM modelling is now sufficiently advanced that it can make useful contributions to process optimisation and equipment design. Finally the parallelisation of such a DEM code is described and benchmark performance results for a large-scale 2D hopper flow are presented.},

	abstract={Abstract Segregation of granular materials is a complex phenomenon, difficult to measure quantitatively and to predict. Discrete element method (DEM) can be a useful tool to predict segregation effects and to support the industrial design. In this context, a very challenging idea is the characterization of the granular solids to provide the key parameters needed for a successful DEM simulation of segregation processes. Rolling friction, sliding friction and the coefficient of restitution are the critical parameters to be studied. These microscopic simulation parameters are calibrated by comparing the macroscopic behavior of granular matter in standard bulk experiments, which have the advantage of being highly repeatable and reliable. An experimental method is presented to characterize free surface segregation. The effects of different particle properties, particularly, shape and size, on segregation of cohesionless materials were investigated. From the experiments, particle size demonstrated a stronger effect on segregation than particle shape. Finally, the corresponding DEM simulations of the segregation experiments were presented. The parameters obtained by calibration were validated by the comparison of the modeled segregation behavior with the experimental results. Thus, calibrated DEM simulations are capable of predicting segregation effects.},

	abstract={Cold compaction of metal powders is now commonly studied at a microscopic scale, to further our understanding of contact mechanics between grains. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is therefore, a good compromise between calculation time and precision. DEM simulations are in general limited to a relative density of about 0.8, because the existing contact laws do not reproduce all the physical phenomena involved in the densification of granular media. Local contact mechanics can be studied by finite element analyses on meshed distinct elements (MDEM, Meshed Distinct Element Method). However, this method is too time-consuming when in the presence of a large number of grains. In the following work, a new analytical contact law will be formulated with MDEM which will subsequently be used to validate the DEM model. Thus, it will be possible with DEM modeling to reproduce high-density compaction of random packings up to a relative density of about 0.95. By introducing a local relative density parameter in the force–displacement relationship, the incompressibility effects which rule high-density behaviors can be introduced in the modeling of powder compaction.},

In the hopper the effect of increasing particle angularity on the flow properties is investigated. Moreover, three different hopper designs are chosen, to further examine the influence of hopper angle and hopper opening size on the flow properties in combination with varying particle shapes. It is demonstrated that particles with an increasing angularity reduce the mass flow rate from the hopper and in case of the flat bottom hopper increase the residual quantity after discharge. In all simulations significant differences between polyhedral and clustered particles were observed, which indicates that the type of particle shape approximation is a parameter that has to be considered in DEM-simulations of hopper discharge.},

The interest is often focused on the particle trajectories, bulk structure, forces and velocities. Research and reviews were carried out on theoretical treatments and applications of DEM, DEM coupled with CFD or in comparison to continuum modelling. Whatever DEM code or contact model is chosen, an elasticity parameter such as the Young's modulus, the shear modulus or yet the loading/unloading stiffness is implemented. The elasticity parameter not only accounts for the deformation behaviour but also for the time step. Concerning the latter one the elasticity is often reduced to lower the running time of a simulation. Our review on the influence of these elasticity parameters on numerical results revealed that in pure numerical studies the elasticity is often reduced, neglecting any probable change of numerical response. However, we also found that awareness of the importance of the elasticity has increased lately. This study is part of the PARDEM research network: www.pardem.eu.},

	abstract={The behaviour of coke, a brittle porous material, under compressive loads is a major factor in determining its quality. Coke samples were compressed using a test stage fitted inside a micro-computed tomography scanner. Threedimensional images of the samples before and after compression were acquired. The before images were used to create finite element (FE) models of the coke. The effective Young’s modulus was found by calibrating the linear elastic model using experimental data. The incremental displacement recorded during the experiments was then applied to the FE models. Comparison of FE analysis results with the after images show high stress concentrations in the areas that cracked during the experiments, as well as reduced stresses in inerts. Displacement plots show a layered crushing pattern similar to that observed experimentally. Empirical models of brittle porous structures were used to estimate the elastic collapse stress of the coke wall. Results indicate that it may be the elastic collapse stress, rather than porosity, which best predicts whether a particular blend of coke will fail in compression.},

	abstract={Abstract This paper presents the best artificial neural network (ANN) model for the estimation of the convective heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of nanofluids flowing through a circular tube with various wall conditions under different flow regimes. The parameters of the ANN model are adjusted by the back propagation learning algorithm using wide ranges of experimental datasets. The developed ANN model shows mean square error (MSE) of 1.7 x 10^-5, absolute average relative deviation, percent (AARD \%) of 2.41 and regression coefficient (R2) of 0.99966 in modeling of overall experimental datasets of convective HTC. The predictive performance of the proposed approach is compared with some reliable correlations which have been proposed in various literatures. The superior performance of the proposed model with respect to other published works has been found through the comparison of results.},

	abstract={Abstract In the present study artificial neural network (ANN) approach was used for the prediction of effect of physical and mechanical properties of Al2024-B4C composites produced by powder metallurgy. Effects of reinforcement size and content (wt.%) on the physical and mechanical properties of composites were determined by measuring the density, hardness and tensile strength values. Density, hardness and tensile values strength of the composites were the outputs obtained from the proposed ANN. It was found that the effect of reinforcement size and content on the homogeneous distribution of B4C particles is as important as the effect of milling time. By comparing the predicted values with the experimental data, it was demonstrated that the well-trained feed forward back propagation ANN model is a powerful tool for prediction of effect of physical and mechanical properties of composites.},

	volume={217},

	pages={409-417},
	abstract={Shape is a computationally expensive property to model in DEM, and so rolling friction is often employed in order to simulate its effects. However, the precise way in which rolling friction models shape has never been properly outlined. This paper presents an attempt to do so by estimating the coefficient of rolling friction for simplified shapes using a simple geometric argument based on the eccentricity of contact. This method was tested by running a series of back-to-back simulations of a simple angle of repose test with clumped particles (simulating shape) and idealised spherical particles with rolling friction. Some similarities were observed, however, quantitatively, there was a significant discrepancy. Approximately half as much rolling friction was required to reproduce the effects of an equivalent amount of shape estimated by the method. This discrepancy is thought to be due to the fact that shape can cause rotation as well as resist it, while rolling friction always acts to oppose rolling motion.},

	abstract={One challenge of todays research is the realistic simulation of granular materials, like sand or powders, consisting of millions of particles. In this article, the discrete element method (DEM), as based on molecular dynamics methods, is introduced.  Contact models are at the physical basis of DEM. A set of the most basic force models is presented involving either elastoplasticity, adhesion, viscosity, static and dynamic friction as well as rolling and torsion resistance.  The examples given concern clustering in granular gases, and biaxial as well as cylindrical shearing of dense packings in order to illustrate the micro macro transition towards continuum theory.}
