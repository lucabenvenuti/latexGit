\section{Application 1: Sinter Chute}
\label{sec:application1sinterchute}
%************************************************

I started to work on the first application, the Cooler Charging Chute of the
Sinter Plant (CCCSP) for one of the industrial partner: PRIMETALS
(ex-Siemens-VAI).
A first version, purely
based on LIGGGHTS, has been developed, with focus over the outflow mass rate 
and the particle distribution in the chute.
PRIMETALS representatives suggested that The simulationâ€™s domain of the CCCSP
should be expanded. It should account for the complete filling of a container 
below the chute and a partial filling of the chute itself.
They also provided me an updated design model.
The focus should be in the particle distribution over vertical sections in these
filled sections. The aim is to demonstrate the deposition of the larger
particles on the bottom.\\
Now I am trying to reach the required filling: there is a large number of
particles involved and I need to optimize the simulation.
