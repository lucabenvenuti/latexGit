\subsection{Jenike's  Shear Cell tester}
\label{subsection:jenikeshearcell}

We have performed from 6 to 16 experiments per bulk material.\\

\subsubsection{SCT simulation}
\label{subsubsection:sctsimulation}

The script has been modified to run on 32 cores over $Mach$. As of now each shear cell experiment is simulated approx. 250 times with different combinations of parameters.\\

\subsection{Angle of Repose}
\label{subsection:aor}

For each bulk have been performed at least 2 experiments, of which the mean, median and variance values have been considered.\\

\subsubsection{AOR simulation}
\label{subsubsection:aorsimulation}

The script has been modified to run on 32 cores over $Mach$. As of now each material is simulated approx. 108 times with different combinations of parameters.\\

\subsection{Granulometric curves}
\label{subsection:granulometric curves}

I have completed sieving of all materials (except from 0 to 1.25 mm iron ore) and I have for them:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the granulometric curve;}
\item{the mean radius (R);}
\end{itemize}
