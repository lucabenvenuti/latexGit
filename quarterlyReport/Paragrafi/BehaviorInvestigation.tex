\section{Behavior Investigation}
\label{section:behaviorinvestigation}
%************************************************

This is the fourth draft of what should be the main topic of my PhD Thesis. 
The \textbf{ToC} is developed accordingly and attached.

\subsection{Investigation topcis}
\label{subsection:investigationtopics}

The scientific core of my PhD Thesis will investigate the following themes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{the influence of variations (distributions) of input parameters,}
%\item{the behavior of the different properties in real life (e.g. segregation before doing the shear cell experiment),}
\item{the influence of and poly-dispersity, i.e. the possbility to extrapolate
(e.g. given 3 different fraction distributions, with known behaviors, extrapolate 
the behavior of a fourth fraction distribution).}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Artificial neural network}
\label{subsection:artificialneuralnetwork}

The first core item has been completed for sinter fine with dedicated Artificial
neural networks ($ANNs$), that has been described in a journal paper draft, see
\ref{sec:elsevierpaper}.\\
