\subsection{Pressure drop tester}
\label{subsection:pressuredroptester}

I should finish soon (I must confess a delay) the realization of a second pressure drop tester, with a diameter 50 \% larger than the old one.
I will also replicate the awesome work done by Niklas Hofer concerning the insurance of a very well defined uniform boundary condition for the temperature.
In opposition to what I saw in Trondheim, that would drive to a really realiable series of experiments.\\

\subsubsection{Pressure drop tester simulation}
\label{subsubsection:pressuredroptestersimulation}

I have not managed to reach the requested volume fraction of 0.6, but only 0.5 working on the input script. The code is currently under modification by Christoph Goniva and Daniel Q. is writing a GUI for the simulation.
I will restart working on it as soon as I will receive both.\\
