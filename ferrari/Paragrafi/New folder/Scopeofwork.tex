The purpose of this PhD thesis is to utilize, develop and set up a handful of characterization devices.
These should be user friendly, as mechanized as possible (to avoid operator bias) and easy to set up, of course with the proper manuals that should also be written.\\
After the data collection physical key parameters of particle flows will be identified; 
this physical information should allow the calibration of series of trustworthy numerical parameters for \ac{dem} (\ac{liggghts}) and FEM (CFDEMcoupling) reliable simulations.
The knowledge gained so far should be applied to industrial processes.\\
