In the training phase (dashed line) from the initial random input parameters
$DEM$ simulations are performed. The behaviours provided are used to train the
Neural Networks ($NN$), in a loop that continues until the difference is within
the limit ($\Delta$).
Then we identify the valid input parameters by comparing (\textbf{=}) $NN$ and
experimental behaviours in the parameters' identification phase (straight line).
Further explanations in the text.

%     memory-bound algorithms inside of the Modify section of the code. MPI-only has
%     low averaged runtimes for each section, but a very large Other timing, which
%     hints for a large amount of load-imbalance. Hybrid timings are a bit worse
%     on average, but because of better balancing, processes have lower wait times
%     inside of Other timing.}
