\caption[Regression graph]{Regression graph. The variation of $R^2$ for
$\mu_{psh}$ with the number of neurons in the NN is shown. The
straight line, referred only to the test simulations, is more sensible to
variations of number of neurons, compared
to the total line. In the latter, also the correlated simulations used for
training participate in the $R^2$ evaluation.}
