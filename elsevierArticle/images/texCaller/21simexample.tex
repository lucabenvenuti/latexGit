\caption[Numerical stress path]{NEW SHORTER GRAPH!!!!! Sample of the numerical
stress path for a shear cell tester simulation, $\sigma_n = 10000 ~[Pa]$.
Although the duration is smaller by two order of magnitude, the stress path is comparable to the experimental one, especially the plateaux.
They were clearly relevant because there we collected the numerical bulk
behaviour representative values.}
