%     memory-bound algorithms inside of the Modify section of the code. MPI-only has
%     low averaged runtimes for each section, but a very large Other timing, which
%     hints for a large amount of load-imbalance. Hybrid timings are a bit worse
%     on average, but because of better balancing, processes have lower wait times
%     inside of Other timing.}
