We have discussed the determination of $DEM$ inter-particle friction and restitution parameters that are critical in medium to dense granular flow simulation.
In particular, we have characterized the materials more commonly used in steel-making, with special regard to their non-sphericity and contact properties.
We used a $SRSCT$, a $JSCT$ and an $AOR$ tester to acquire experimental data. 
Then we employed a numerical shear cell tester and a numerical $AOR$ tester for the simulations.
We extended our numerical results by mean of artificial neural networks.
Since our results for iron ore, limestone and glass silibeads are in very good agreement with published data and in-house experiments, we can conclude that the described experimental and simulation setup successfully defined the $DEM$ parameters for these materials. 
Furthermore, the effectiveness of $LIGGGHTS$ as simulation software has again been demonstrated.\\
