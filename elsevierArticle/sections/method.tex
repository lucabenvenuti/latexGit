\subsection{Discrete element method}
\label{subsec:dem}
The $DEM$ is based on a relatively elementary idea. For each particle i inside
the domain it follows the course and calculate the force of that exerts on particle j
by integrating Newton' second law:
\input{equations/newtonlaw}
and the position and orientation equations.
The main forces interested are: gravitation, contact forces due to collisions,
solid-solid interactions such as electrostatic, Van der Waals, cohesive forces
and fluid-solid interactions in multiphase flows.

For the raw materials used in this work \cite{RefWorks:145} suggested using the non-linear Hertzian model without cohesion for the particle-particle and particle-wall contacts.\\
This granular model uses the following formula for the force between two granular particles (Eq. \ref{eq:forceij}):
\input{equations/forceij}
while the tangential force component is truncated to fulfill
\input{equations/force_t}
Both the normal and the tangential force comprise two terms, a spring force and a damping force. The shear force is a "history" effect that accounts for the tangential displacement 
("tangential overlap") between the particles for the duration of contact. \\

The $k_n$, $k_t$, $\gamma_n$, and $\gamma_t$ coefficients are calculated from the material properties as follows:
\input{equations/hertz}
In addition to the equations \ref{eq:hertz} the following relations (Eqns. \ref{eq:equivProp2}) are required:
\input{equations/equivProp2}

The $\mu_r$ parameter enters the equations according to the elasto-rolling resistance model presented by \cite{RefWorks:87} and \cite{RefWorks:131}, also used by \cite{RefWorks:147}, 
based on the work of \cite{RefWorks:143}(and in contrast to \cite{RefWorks:144}). The model is called EPSD2 in LIGGGHTS.
This is appropriate for the one way rolling cases as well as the cycling rolling ones.
The total rolling resistance torque is (Eq. \ref{eq:mrtm}):
\input{equations/mrtm}

Given these equations, completely defining a dry material for DEM simulations requires these data:
\begin{itemize}
\item{the radius of the particles ($R$);}
\item{the Young's modulus ($E$) and the Poisson's coefficient ($\nu$);}
\item{the particle density ($\rho_p$) and the coefficient of restitution ($e$);}
\item{the coefficients of sliding ($\mu_s$) and rolling ($\mu_r$) friction.}
\end{itemize}


Further details on the method can be found in \cite{RefWorks:133}.

The coefficient of sliding friction for coarse round particles is a critical
parameter describing inter-particle friction in medium to dense granular flows simulations.
It is proportional to the torque counteracting the rotation of the particle and defined as (Eq. \ref{equ:mur}):
\input{equations/mur}

Furthermore, we used Hertz' Law for the particle-particle and particle-wall interactions.
