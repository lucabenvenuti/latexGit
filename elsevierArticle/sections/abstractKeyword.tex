\begin{abstract}
In Discrete Element Method ($DEM$) simulations, particle-particle contact laws
determine the macroscopic simulation results. Particle based contact laws, in
turn, commonly rely on semi-empirical parameters, which can be hardly obtained by direct measurements.
In this study we present a methodology for the identification of particle based
DEM simulation parameters by means of macroscopic experiments and dedicated
artificial neural networks. 
In a first step, the macroscopic results of a series
of DEM simulations with varying simulation parameters are used to train a feed
forward artificial neural network by backward propagation reinforcement. In a
second step, this artificial neural network can be harnessed to predict the
macroscopic ensemble behaviour in dependence of additional sets of particle
based simulation parameters.
As a result, a comprehensive database is obtained,
which links particle based simulation parameters to a specific macroscopic ensemble output.
The trained artificial neural network is able to predict the behaviour of
additional sets of input parameters accurately and highly efficient.
Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to different macroscopic behaviours
picturing dedicated calibration experiments.
By the help of these experiments, the DEM simulation parameters of a specific granular material can be identified.
