	abstract={Particulate systems are of interest in many disciplines. They are often investigated using the discrete element method because of its capability to investigate particulate systems at the individual particle scale. To model the interaction between two particles and between a particle and a boundary, conventional discrete element models use springs and dampers in both the normal and tangential directions. The significance of particle rotation has been highlighted in both numerical studies and physical experiments. Several researchers have attempted to incorporate a rotational torque to account for the rolling resistance or rolling friction by developing different models. This paper presents a review of the commonly used models for rolling resistance and proposes a more general model. These models are classified into four categories according to their key characteristics. The robustness of these models in reproducing rolling resistance effects arising from different physical situations was assessed by using several benchmarking test cases. The proposed model can be seen to be more general and suitable for modelling problems involving both dynamic and pseudo-static regimes. An example simulation of the formation of a 2D sandpile is also shown. For simplicity, all formulations and examples are presented in 2D form, though the general conclusions are also applicable to 3D systems.},

	title={Determining the coefficient of friction by shear tester simulation},
	pages={335-342},
	abstract={The flow behaviour of very dense particle regimes such as in a moving or fluidized bed is highly dependent on the inter-particle friction, which can be characterized by the coefficient of friction. Since only rough guide values for common material pairs are available in the literature, we determine the exact parameters by fitting numerical simulations to experimental measurements of a simplified Jenike shear tester.  The open-source discrete-element-method code LIGGGHTS is used to model the shear cell, which is built of triangulated meshes. In order to preload the bulk solid in the shear cell with a constant principal stress, the movement of these walls is controlled by a prescribed load.  A comprehensive sensitivity study shows that the results are nearly insensitive to the spatial dimensions of the shear tester as well as all other material properties. Therefore, this set-up is applicable to determine the coefficient of friction.  Furthermore, we calculate the coefficient of friction of glass beads showing very good agreement with literature data and in-house experiments. Hence, this procedure can be used to deduce material parameters for the numerical simulation of dense granular flows.}

Both the DEM and the CFDDEM approach are successfully tested against analytics as well as experimental data.},

	pages={239-245},
	abstract={Many characterization techniques are available to determine the flow properties of powders; however, it is debated which method(s) are the most appropriate. In this study, sample fine powders with a medium particle size between 22 and 31 microm were characterized using a variety of techniques that tested powders under different stress states, ranging from static to dynamic. It was found that characterization techniques that were more dynamic such as fluidized bed expansion were best suited for predicting the fluidization performance while characterization techniques that were more static such as cohesion were better for predicting agglomeration. It was also found that results from static and dynamic characterization do not necessarily agree, where fine powders that showed good fluidization performance also displayed increased agglomeration, and vice versa. This suggests that flow properties are dependent upon the stress state and that no single technique is suitable for the full characterization of a powder. In other words, both static and dynamic characterization techniques must be employed to completely understand the flow properties of a powder and predict how it will behave under different process conditions.},

	volume={16},

	pages={598-604},
	abstract={The discrete element method (DEM) is a proven numerical technique for modelling the multibody collision behavior of particulate systems. This method is used here to study the motion of ball charge in tumbling mills. To get meaningful results, it is essential that the parameters involved in the model be carefully determined. These parameters embody essentially the material properties of the system: stiffness, damping, and friction. In this study, all the parameters are carefully determined experimentally for different operating mill conditions. A computer code based on DEM has been developed to model the motion of the balls in tumbling mills. The code incorporates a scheme to calculate the applied torque, and hence power input to the mill. A 55-cm ball mill is simulated for two different liner cross-sectionsâ€” rectangular and triangular. Results of the simulations pertaining to applied torque are compared with the experiments. It is found that, with a particular model for the coefficient of friction, the predicted torque agrees well with the experiments.},

	volume={217},

	pages={409-417},
	abstract={Shape is a computationally expensive property to model in DEM, and so rolling friction is often employed in order to simulate its effects. However, the precise way in which rolling friction models shape has never been properly outlined. This paper presents an attempt to do so by estimating the coefficient of rolling friction for simplified shapes using a simple geometric argument based on the eccentricity of contact. This method was tested by running a series of back-to-back simulations of a simple angle of repose test with clumped particles (simulating shape) and idealised spherical particles with rolling friction. Some similarities were observed, however, quantitatively, there was a significant discrepancy. Approximately half as much rolling friction was required to reproduce the effects of an equivalent amount of shape estimated by the method. This discrepancy is thought to be due to the fact that shape can cause rotation as well as resist it, while rolling friction always acts to oppose rolling motion.},
