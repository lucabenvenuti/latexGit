Particles in various forms - ranging from raw materials to food grains and pharmaceutical powders - 
play a major role in a variety of industries, including process industry and metallurgy. 
In his book, \citet{RefWorks:117} stated that "between 1 and 10\% of all the energy is used in 
comminution, i.e. the processes of crushing, grinding, milling, micronising". 

Discrete Element Methods ($DEMs$) , "a special class of numerical schemes for
simulating the behavior of discrete, interacting bodies", are widely used to 
simulate particle behaviour in these granular processes (Cleary and Sawley \cite{RefWorks:130}).\\
In their original formulation of $DEM$, Cundall and Strack \cite{RefWorks:172} allowed two 
particles to slightly overlap upon contact, and consequently they proposed
repulsive forces in relation to this overlap distance.
The force that particle i exerts on particle j is defined as:
