\chapter{Discrete Element Method}
\label{cap:dem}
%************************************************

The discrete element method (\acs{DEM}) is derived from Molecular Dynamics. \\ 
For each particle $i$ inside the domain, a \acs{DEM} code
follows the trajectory and calculates the force that particle $i$ exerts on
particle $j$.
The main forces involved are: gravity, contact forces due to collisions, and
further interactions such as electrostatic, Van der Waals, cohesive forces and fluid-solid interactions in 
multiphase flows. \\
Two approaches can be implemented for this method:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{hard spheres,}
  \item{soft spheres.}
\end{itemize} 
The hard-sphere approach is well-suited for binary collisions, easy to
calculate, but cannot predict multi-particle interactions.
It is mainly used for dilute flows, rather then in the dense flows we
investigated.

\section{Soft sphere approach}
\label{sec:softspheresapproach}

\info{could use tikz for this image}
\input{images/109twospheres}
The soft sphere approach consider the deformations of particles when they
collide with each other. From the vector in Fig. \ref{fig:109twospheres} we can
define after time \textit{t} the normal and tangential overlaps \acs{xin} and
\acs{xit}:
\input{equations/xin}
\input{equations/xit}
where the subscript \acs{n} stands for normal and \acs{t} for tangential. 
At this point we can divide the contact models into:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{linear, e.g. Hooke,}
  \item{non-linear, e.g. Hertz.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hertz}
\label{subsec:hertz}

For the raw material used in this work 
Di Renzo and Di Maio \cite{RefWorks:145} suggested using the non-linear
Hertzian model without cohesion for the particle-particle and particle-wall contacts. 
For an elasto-perfectly-plastic-viscous model the contact forces, normal and
tangential, are:
\input{equations/fn}
\input{equations/ft}
The Coulomb's law of friction is the condition in the tangential force
formulation.
Here, $k$ and $\gamma$ are respectively the stiffness and damping coefficients, 
while \textbf{v} is the velocity.
Both the normal and the tangential
force comprise two terms, a spring force and a damping force. 
The tangential (or shear) force is a ``history'' effect that accounts for the
tangential displacement (``tangential overlap'') between the particles for the
duration of contact.
\info{add to acronyms}
The $k_n$, $k_t$, $\gamma_n$, and $\gamma_t$ coefficients are calculated from
the material properties as follows:
%************************************************
\input{equations/hertz}

In addition to the equations \ref{eq:hertz} the following relations (Eqns. \ref{eq:equivProp2}) are required:

The coefficient of sliding friction \acs{mus} is 
one of the particle-based \acs{DEM} parameter we investigated, 
another being the coefficient of rolling friction (\acs{mur}),
that can be simulated with these models:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{constant direct torque (CDT),}
  \item{elasto-plastic-spring-dashpot.}
\end{itemize}

In the paper by Wensrich and Katterfeld \cite{RefWorks:87}, further details on
the method can be found.\\

% \subsection{Hooke}
% \label{subsec:hooke}


%This granular model uses the following formula for the contact force between
% two granular particles (Eq. \ref{eq:forceij}):
% %************************************************
% \input{equations/forceij}
% %************************************************


% , $r$ is the
% distance between two particles of radii $R_i$ and $R_j$, and $d = R_i + R_j $ is
% % the contact distance.

% In the contact law we used, 
% the tangential component of the contact force between two generic particles
% ($F_t$) is truncated to fulfil:

\subsection{Elasto-plastic-spring-dashpot 2}
\label{subsec:epsd2}

For coarse non-spherical particles, \acs{mur} is a critical parameter and describes
inter-particle friction in medium to dense granular flow simulations. It is proportional to the 
torque counteracting the rotation of the particle. The \acs{mur} parameter enters the 
equations according to the elasto-rolling resistance model presented by Wensrich and 
Katterfeld \cite{RefWorks:87} and Ai et al. \cite{RefWorks:131} 
based on the work of Jiang et al. \cite{RefWorks:143}. 
The model is called EPSD2 in \acs{LIGGGHTS} and is appropriate for both one-way and cyclical rolling cases.
The maximum magnitude of rolling resistance torque is (Eq. \ref{eq:trmax}):

%************************************************
\input{equations/trmax}
%************************************************

where $R_r$ is the equivalent radius and $F_n$ the normal force.
The last two particle-based \acs{DEM} parameters we investigated were 
the particle density (\acs{rhop})
and the coefficient of restitution (\acs{CoR}) as defined by
\citet{RefWorks:131}.
Together with the others they are listed in Table \ref{tab:08DEMparameters}.\\

\section{Literature Values}
\label{sec:literaturevalues}

There are yet ways to determine contact parameters directly by measuring
material properties or by performing particle based experiments, see e.g.
\citet{RefWorks:177}, \citet{RefWorks:181}, and \citet{RefWorks:186}.
\citet{RefWorks:140} and \citet{RefWorks:190}
are two of the most prominent examples of parameters identification by
theoretical analysis. However, they focused on glass spheres, while
non-sphericity was one of the fields we wanted to investigate. 
Further, it is related to all the microscopic parameters we analysed. 
Also the procedure of \citet{RefWorks:177}, although on
industrial samples (aluminium oxide), still had mostly spherical particles. 
In addition, these methodologies are laborious, 
since they have to be performed for every new granular material prior to a $DEM$
simulations. 
Especially for the already cited rolling friction parameter, it is arduous to
link the rolling friction parameter to the non-sphericity of the particle. 


\section{Unresolved CFD-DEM}
\label{sec:unresolvedcfddem}
%************************************************

The existence of particles immersed in a fluid influences its behaviour. 
Keeping aside the short-scale flow field, the local averages inside the
Navier-Stokes fluid equations could account for the particles.
On the hypothesis of having \textit{g(r)} a convenient averaging function, which
is non-negative, smooth, asyntotically zero for large $r$, normalized, we can
define the local void fraction ($\varepsilon(\mathbf{r},t)$), the volume of the
fluid ($V_f(t)$) over the total volume, as:

\wrong{check all equations and add images}

\input{equations/voidfraction}
We define local mean values of fluid point properties as:
\input{equations/a}
which came from a slowly varying a rapidly fluctuating part:
\input{equations/a2}
Particle properties, on the solid volume $V_s(t)$ and the solid fraction
$\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$, are expressed as field quantities as:
\input{equations/b}
The approximation is valid when $g(r)$ varies slowly over the particles length
scale.
