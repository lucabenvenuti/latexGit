In our study, we harnessed Artificial Neural Networks (\acs{ANNs}) in order to
reduce the number of \acs{DEM} test simulations required
to characterize bulk materials for large scale simulations. \\
As the following chapters will show, we divided this task in two sections:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{identification of \acs{DEM} parameters, in part
  \ref{par:identification},}
  \item{applications, in part \ref{par:applications}.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Aim for Neural Network}
\label{sec:aimforneuralnetwork}

\acs{ANNs} have proven to be a versatile tool in analysing complex, non-linear
systems of multi-dimensional input streams (Vaferi et al. \cite{RefWorks:150}, Witten et
al. \cite{RefWorks:174} and Haykin \cite{RefWorks:158}).
In our case, we fed an \acs{ANN} with \acs{DEM} contact law parameters as input
and compared the output with the bulk behaviour 
predicted by a corresponding \acs{DEM} simulation. 
The difference between \acs{ANN} prediction and \acs{DEM} prediction was used to
train our specific \acs{ANN} with a backward-propagation algorithm. 
\input{images/127anntraining}
After a training phase comprising a limited number of \acs{DEM} test simulations,
the \acs{ANN} could then be used as a stand-alone prediction tool for the bulk behaviour of a 
granular material in relation to \acs{DEM} contact law parameters, see Fig.
\ref{fig:127anntraining}. \\
In this study, we applied this parameter identification method to two different
granular bulk behaviours, namely the angle of repose (\acs{AoR}) test and the
Schulze shear cell (\acs{SCT}) test.
In both cases, we first trained a specific \acs{ANN} using a number of \acs{DEM} test
simulations before we identified valid sets of \acs{DEM} contact law parameters by
comparing the stand-alone \acs{ANN} predictions with corresponding bulk experiments. 
For both cases we obtained valid sets of contact law parameters, 
which we then compared to formulate a reliable contact law for a given
granular material.
We further showed that the same \acs{ANN} could be used to characterize different
granular materials, which have the same particle behaviour and could modelled with the same contact
law.
