The existence of particles immersed in a fluid influences its behaviour. 
Keeping aside the short-scale flow field, the local averages inside the
Navier-Stokes fluid equations could account for the particles.
On the hypothesis of having \textit{g(r)} a convenient averaging function, which
is non-negative, smooth, asyntotically zero for large $r$, normalized, we can
define the local void fraction ($\varepsilon(\mathbf{r},t)$), the volume of the
fluid ($V_f(t)$) over the total volume, as:
\input{equations/voidfraction}
We define local mean values of fluid point properties as:
\input{equations/a}
which came from a slowly varying a rapidly fluctuating part:
\input{equations/a2}
Particle properties, on the solid volume $V_s(t)$ and the solid fraction
$\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$, are expressed as field quantities as:
\input{equations/b}
The approximation is valid when $g(r)$ varies slowly over the particles length
scale.
