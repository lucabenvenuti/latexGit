We have presented a two-step method for $DEM$ simulation parameter
identification. In the first step, an artificial neural network is 
trained using dedicated $DEM$ simulations in order to predict bulk 
behaviours as function of a set of $DEM$ simulation parameters. 
In the second step, this artificial neural network is then used 
to predict the bulk behaviour of a huge number of additional $DEM$ parameter
sets.
The main findings of this study can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{An artificial neural network can be trained by a limited number of
  dedicated $DEM$ simulations.
  		The trained artificial neural network is then able to predict
  		granular bulk behaviour.}
  \item{This prediction of granular bulk behaviour is much more efficient
  		than computationally expensive $DEM$ simulations.
  		Thus, the macroscopic output associated with a huge number of parameter sets
  		can be studied.}
  \item{If the predictions of the artificial neural network are compared to a bulk experiment, 
  		valid sets of $DEM$ simulation parameters can be readily deduced for a
  		specific granular material.}
  \item{This $DEM$ parameter identification method can be applied to
  arbitrary bulk experiments.
  		Combining two artificial neural networks which predict two different bulk
  		behaviours leads to winnowing the set of valid $DEM$ simulation parameters.}
\end{itemize}
As part of future work, we will develop this method further by considering
different fractions of granular materials, which will lead to size-dependent sets of $DEM$
simulation parameters.
