There are two main phases:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Initial filling: during this phase many small particles deposited inside
  the chute}
  \item{Moving bottom box: also in this phase particles were
continuously inserted from the top. After the filling was completed, the
scraper was moved and all the particles further a defined surface were
deleted. Inside the sinter, all the places that small particles could
occupy already were. At this point the bottom box was filled again, but
with a more realistic size distribution, and it reached steady state, as can
be seen in figures \ref{fig:043rS1}, \ref{fig:044rS2}, \ref{fig:045rS4}, and
\ref{fig:046rS6}.}
\end{itemize}
As expected, when the steady state was reached, the particles actually
segregated, as it was intended to demonstrate.
In fact, there were more particles with larger radiuses, from 8 to 25 mm, in the
bottom layers.
Instead, the smallest particles, radius = 2.5 mm, was rather on the top layer.
