The raceway, a critical portion of the blast furnace (Fig.
\ref{fig:068racewaylayout}), was investigated.
We performed a limited number of simulations of this volume to investigate the
effect of the variation of input velocity.\\
The results presented in Fig. \ref{fig:068racewaylayout}, Fig.
\ref{fig:225racewayu}, Fig. \ref{fig:238racewayus}, and Fig.
\ref{fig:239racewayvf} were later compared with the literature data from
\citet{RefWorks:208}.

% Later, we trained a dedicated \acs{ANN} to evaluate the contribution of each of
% these parameters over the final results.
