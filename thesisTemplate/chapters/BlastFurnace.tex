\section{Blast furnace design}
\label{sec:bfdesign}

Well explained in the vast literature (\cite{RefWorks:203}), 
iron making consists in separating the iron from its chemical combination with
oxygen. 
As of now, the blast furnace (Fig. \ref{fig:125blastfurnace}) is considered the
most efficient process.

\input{images/319raceway}

\subsection{Structure}
\label{subsec:bfstructure}

The blast furnace is a massive vertical apparatus, built with consistent amounts
of refractory materials and a robust steel shell.
The areas in front of each tuyere, which can be seen in Fig.
\ref{fig:125blastfurnace}, is called $raceway$ and is the most active. 
We dedicated this chapter to the investigation of its behaviour.

\subsection{Simulation prerequisites}
\label{subsec:simulationprerequisites}

Given its axial-symmetric geometry and according to \citet{RefWorks:208}, we
considered only a wedge and applied periodic boundary conditions.
Three tuyeres and a sufficiently high space over and under them were used to
grant uniform conditions.
As in \citet{RefWorks:208}, 15,000 cells were created for the mesh, shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:273layoutbf}. 
The tuyeres were considered as inlets. Air is inserted with a velocity of 100
m/s, a density of $1.1885 kg/m^3$ and a kinematic viscosity of $1.5 \cdot
10^{-5} m^2/s$.\\
We performed two of simulations of this volume to investigate
the effect of the variation of the \acl{mus} (\acs{mus}):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{\acs{mus} = 0.1, or reduced,}
  \item{\acs{mus} = 0.9, or real, obtained from the parameter identification.}
\end{enumerate}
The remaining \acs{DEM} parameters can be found in Table
\ref{tab:36BFDEMvalues}, derived from the parameters identified in the previous
Chapter \ref{cap:anntraining}.
The procedure to obtain the equivalent \acs{DEM} parameters from those of the
materials involved can be found in \citet{RefWorks:208}, together with the
particle distribution, which drove us into using approximately 160,000 particles
for each simulation.
This amount allowed us to completely filled the setup.
On top, a servo-wall, similar to the \acs{SCT} simulation, consented to apply
the correct load conditions inside the system.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:resultsbf}

In accordance to the literature (\cite{RefWorks:203, RefWorks:208}) we focused
on the gases, or fluid, velocity and the particles velocity in a vertical slice
of the simulation domain of the two simulations.
Further, we investigated the penetration depth of the raceway 

\subsection{Fluid velocity}
\label{subsec:fluidvelocity}

The change of sliding friction coefficients bear no effect on the
velocity of the gases. 

\input{images/299u_average_lf}

\subsection{Particle velocity}
\label{subsec:particlevelocity}

However, the particles velocity is clearly, and logically, higher for low
friction particles. 
They could be moved by the flow more easily compared to high
friction particles, see Fig. \ref{fig:300us_average_lf}.
