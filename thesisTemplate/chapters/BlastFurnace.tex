\section{Blast furnace design}
\label{sec:bfdesign}

Well explained in the vast literature (\cite{RefWorks:203}), 
iron making consists in separating the iron from its chemical combination with
oxygen. 
As of now, the blast furnace (Fig. \ref{fig:125blastfurnace}) is considered the
most efficient process.

\input{images/319raceway}

\subsection{Structure}
\label{subsec:bfstructure}

The blast furnace is a massive vertical apparatus, built with consistent amounts
of refractory materials and a robust steel shell.
The areas in front of each tuyere, which can be seen in Fig.
\ref{fig:125blastfurnace}, is called $raceway$ and is the most active. 
We dedicated this chapter to the investigation of its behaviour.

\subsection{Simulation prerequisites}
\label{subsec:simulationprerequisites}

Given its axial-symmetric geometry and according to \citet{RefWorks:208}, we
considered only a wedge and applied periodic boundary conditions.
Three tuyeres, instead of a single one, and a sufficiently high space over and
under them were used to grant uniform conditions.
As in \citet{RefWorks:208}, 15,000 cells were created for the mesh, shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:273layoutbf}. 
The tuyeres were considered as inlets. Air is inserted with a velocity of 100
m/s, a density of $1.1885 kg/m^3$ and a kinematic viscosity of $1.5 \cdot
10^{-5} m^2/s$.\\
We performed two of simulations of this volume to investigate
the effect of the variation of the \acl{mus} (\acs{mus}):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{\acs{mus} = 0.1, or reduced,}
  \item{\acs{mus} = 0.9, or real, obtained from the parameter identification.}
\end{enumerate}
The remaining \acs{DEM} parameters can be found in Table
\ref{tab:36BFDEMvalues}, derived from the parameters identified in the previous
Chapter \ref{cap:anntraining}.
The procedure to obtain the equivalent \acs{DEM} parameters from those of the
materials involved can be found in \citet{RefWorks:208}, together with the
particle distribution, which drove us into using approximately 160,000 particles
for each simulation.
This amount allowed us to completely filled the setup.
On top, a servo-wall, similar to the \acs{SCT} simulation, consented to apply
the correct load conditions inside the system.
Each simulation lasted 195 hours on a 32 cores machine.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:resultsbf}

In accordance to the literature (\cite{RefWorks:203, RefWorks:208}) we focused
on the gases, or fluid, velocity and the particles velocity in a vertical slice
of the simulation domain of the two simulations, in correspondance of the most
inner inlet.
Further, we investigated the penetration depth of the raceway in an horizontal
slice of the system, following the indications of \citet{RefWorks:208}.

\subsection{Fluid velocity}
\label{subsec:fluidvelocity}

As thoroughly explained in the literature (\cite{RefWorks:198, RefWorks:199}),
the change of sliding friction coefficients bear limited effect on the velocity
of the gases. In Fig. \ref{fig:299u_average_lf} we plotted the spatially
interpolated values for the fluid velocity, together with the velocity vector
arrows and the stream lines, for the two simulations investigated.

\input{images/299u_average_lf}

\subsection{Particle velocity}
\label{subsec:particlevelocity}

On the other hand, and again according to the literature (\cite{RefWorks:198,
RefWorks:199}), the particles velocity is clearly, and logically, higher for low friction particles. 
They could be moved by the flow more easily compared to high
friction particles, see Fig. \ref{fig:300us_average_lf}.
Again, the spatially
interpolated values for the particles velocity, together with the velocity
vector arrows and the stream lines, for the two simulations investigated, can be seen.
In this plot the particles are represented as a fluid occupying the particles
space. 
Thus, a certain degree of smoothing must be taken into account.
However, the raceway area is clearly larger in the reduced \acs{mus}
simulation, testifying the consistent effect of this parameter in the overall
results. \\

\input{images/300us_average_lf}

We decided for this reason to represent each particle present in the domain
slice considered in Fig. \ref{fig:298verticalslicelf}.
As suggested by \citet{RefWorks:208}, we colored differently the particles
faster or slower than a series of fixed velocity thresholds. 
So, we were able to investigate to which extent
from the inlet particles were set into motion.\\
It is clearly visible that the red, and faster, particles are in superior
numbers for the low friction simulations.
Further, in the high friction case, we can see in Fig.
\ref{fig:268ver_slice_001mshf} that there are low velocities area even close to
the raceway, condition not present in the low friction case.

\subsection{Penetration depth}
\label{subsec:penetrationdepth}

\citet{RefWorks:208} calculates the raceway penetration depth with Merry's
model:
\input{equations/racewaypenetration}
with $d_T$ as the tuyere diameter, $d_p$ is the particle diameter, averaged in
our case, $\rho_f$ and $\rho_p$ are the fluid and particle
density, respectively. Of course, $u$ is the inlet velocity and $g$ represents
the gravitational constant.
Her results estimate a penetration depth of 0.8 meters.\\
Our results, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:286hor_slice_01ms}, were inferior to this
estimation.
\citet{RefWorks:208} suggested two main reasons for the discrepancy between
\acs{CFD}-\acs{DEM} numerical results and theoretical analysis: a) only the
particles with size over a defined diameter were modelled, and b) the void
fraction inside the experimental setup is unknown and, thus, impossible to model
reliably.\\
Especially, a) was due to computational considerations.
Including in the particle distribution even the small particles led to an
increase of the amount of particles to more than half a million.
In addition, this brought the computational time for a single simulation with 32
cores to exceed a month duration.
We attempted to reduce the simulation domain to keep the particle distribution
and to consider at the same time a reduced amount of particles.
Due to the unsufficient volume, the raceway could not properly develop, the
results were inconclusive, and even channeling was observed.
A complete discussion of this attempt is out of the scope of this thesis.
