\section{Blast furnace design}
\label{sec:bfdesign}

Well explained in the vast literature (\cite{RefWorks:203}), 
iron making consists in separating the iron from its chemical combination with
oxygen. 
As of now, the blast furnace (Fig. \ref{fig:125blastfurnace}) is considered the
most efficient process.

\input{images/319raceway}

\subsection{Structure}
\label{subsec:bfstructure}

The blast furnace is a massive vertical apparatus, built with consistent amounts
of refractory materials and a robust steel shell.
The areas in front of each tuyere, which can be seen in Fig.
\ref{fig:125blastfurnace}, is called $raceway$ and is the most active. 
We dedicated this chapter to the investigation of its behaviour.

\subsection{Simulation prerequisites}
\label{subsec:simulationprerequisites}

Given its axial-symmetric geometry and according to \citet{RefWorks:208}, we
considered only a wedge and applied periodic boundary conditions.
Three tuyeres and a sufficiently high space over and under them were used to
grant uniform conditions.
As in \citet{RefWorks:208}, 15,000 cells were created for the mesh, shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:273layoutbf}. 
We performed two of simulations of this volume to investigate the effect of the
variation of the \acl{mus} (\acs{mus}):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{\acs{mus} = 0.1, or reduced,}
  \item{\acs{mus} = 0.9, or real, obtained from the parameter identification.}
\end{enumerate}
The remaining \acs{DEM} parameters can be found in Table
\ref{tab:36BFDEMvalues}, derived from the parameters identified in the previous
Chapter \ref{cap:anntraining}.
The procedure to obtain the equivalent \acs{DEM} parameters from those of the
materials involved can be found in \citet{RefWorks:208}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:resultsbf}

The change of sliding friction coefficients bear no effect on the
velocity of the gases. 
However, the particles velocity is clearly, and logically, higher for low
friction particles. 
They could be moved by the flow more easily compared to high
friction particles, see Fig. \ref{fig:300us_average_lf}.
