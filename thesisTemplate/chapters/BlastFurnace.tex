The raceway, a critical portion of the blast furnace, was investigated. We
performed a limited number of simulations of this volume to investigate the
effect of friction, sphericity and particle distribution.
Later, we trained a dedicated \acs{ANN} to evaluate the contribution of each of
these parameters over the final results.
