\section{Regression statistic}
\label{sec:regressionstatistic}

We start with a set of random variables, aiming to find a relationship between
them. We choose one of them ($response$), and we infer its dependance from the
others ($regressors$), also including an additive $error$ term. We call this a
\textit{regression model}, which can be linear or nonlinear.

\section{ANN intro}
\label{sec:annintro}
%\improvement{Add some more details from Haykin introduction}
An Artificial Neural Network (\acs{ANN}) is a powerful regression model, 
based on non-linear functions (Haykin \cite{RefWorks:158}). 
In fact, we can see a neural network as a huge and parallel computer, composed
of many processing units. It stores experienced knowledge and translates it in
an usable form. 
The biological inspiration for artificial neural networks can be seen in Fig.
\ref{fig:049neuron1}. It resembles the human brain especially because it
uses a learning process to acquire knowledge, which is stored through the
synaptic weights.

\input{images/049neuron1}

In this work, we first used the \acs{ANN} to fit the \acs{DEM} numerical simulation
data, and then to process a vast number of parameters combinations. 
\acs{ANNs} map combinations of input data to convenient outputs (fitting). 
There is a variety of \acs{ANNs} available; important for our context were the
Feedforward ($FF$) and the Radial basis function ($RBF$). 
For $FF-NN$, 
numerous training algorithms are available. The most common are based on
backpropagation, e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian regulation and the scaled
conjugate gradient.

\section{Perceptron}
\label{sec:perceptron}

The basic element of an artificial neural network is the perceptron, see Fig.
\ref{fig:064perceptron}, that is mathematically described by equation
\ref{eq:perceptron}: 
\input{equations/perceptron}
where $x_j$ are the input nodes, $y$ is the output node, $w_j$ are the weights
and $b$ is the bias.
\input{images/064perceptron}
In the simplest case  the activation function $\varphi(\cdot)$ is an hard
limiter, or a signum function.
Consequently, $y$ can be +1, for positive inputs, or -1, for negative inputs. Inputs of the first class
belong to class $\mathscr{C}_1$, of the second to class $\mathscr{C}_2$.
Thus, the patterns ($y$) are hypothesised to be linearly separable.
In this case the training, as identification of the correct weights and bias,
can be precisely mathematically described.
\input{images/105doublemoon2}
The classical example of the double moon, see Fig. \ref{fig:105doublemoon2},
clarifies the limits of the single perceptron approach, especially 
why a single neuron is not capable to handle a
nonlinear problem.
As long as the distance $d$ is positive, the domain can easily be
linearly separated in two regions.

\section{Multilayer}
\label{sec:multilayer}

\input{images/063doublemoon}

The handling of multiple outputs or, in our example, 
when $d$ becomes negative, see Fig. \ref{fig:063doublemoon}, makes linear
separation not possible, and a multineuron approach necessary. 
The first requirement of a multilayer neural network
is that each neuron of the network must have differentiable nonlinear activation
function, such as the strictly increasing hyperbolic tangent.
Further, the network has at least one layer $hidden$ from both the input and the
output nodes, see Fig. \ref{fig:018nnscheme}.
An high degree of $connectivity$ is another salient characteristic, dependent on
the synaptic weights of the network.

\section{Backpropagation algorithm}
\label{sec:backpropagationalgorithm}

A multilayer perceptrons can be trained with the back-propagation algorithm,
composed of two phases, forward and backward.
In the first phase the weights do not change. 
From the inputs through the hidden
and output layers the output is computed. 
In the second phase the error is calculated as the difference between the output
and the response, and used to tune the weights, backward from the output to
hidden layers.
Of course, it arises the problem of when stopping the loop.


To be able to handle non-linearly separable data, the standard linear perceptron
\acs{ANN} was modified to obtain \textit{FF Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks
(MLPNN)}.
Here, each processing unit or node (neuron) possesses a nonlinear activation function. 
They are interconnected to form layers that are also interlinked. 
The validity of the $MLPNN$, with a backpropagation reinforcement learning 
training algorithm (scaled conjugate gradient), has been demonstrated in the 
literature, see Haykin \cite{RefWorks:158}. Several scientists 
\cite{RefWorks:161, RefWorks:166, RefWorks:167, RefWorks:168, RefWorks:169,
RefWorks:170, RefWorks:178, RefWorks:179} have employed \acs{ANNs} to model
the mechanical properties of materials.

\section{Our ANNs}
\label{sec:ouranns}

\wrong{change subsection title}

Following the best practice suggested by Vaferi et al. \cite{RefWorks:150}, we
used $MLPNN$.
Further, the quality of the \acs{ANN} data had to be examined critically. 
Haykin \cite{RefWorks:158} 
suggested considering the quality of (a) \acs{ANN} training process and (b) the
subsequent data generation based on the inputs provided.
Task (a) is particularly important
when dealing with experimental training data, and
usually addressed
by noise-corrupted pattern calibration
and by comparison with standard statistical methods.
However, our training pool was numerical and extensive, 
and the particles in our simulations were inserted using a random
seed value.
For vast amounts of training data, the effect of noise-corrupted patterns is
negligible, see Haykin \cite{RefWorks:158}.
We used the Bayesian linear and the Gaussian non linear regressions to further
assess the quality of the training.
Thus, in our work task (b) was more challenging.
Once trained, the \acs{ANN} were fed
combinations of \acs{DEM} parameters. 
We tried different methods to generate these combinations. 
Our first attempt consisted of assigning parameters to the investigated
variables in even increments from the minimum to the maximum values. 
For example, the \acs{CoR} ranged from 0.5 to 0.9, and thus the first value was
0.5, the second 0.508163, and so on.
To increase generalization, we decided to follow a different approach: 
random value generators created the number of required values in the defined
ranges for each parameter investigated.
These were combined and used as input.\\
