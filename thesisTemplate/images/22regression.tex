\caption[Comparison between prediction of the trained ANN and full DEM
simulation]{Comparison between prediction of the trained Artificial Neural
Network ($ANN$) and 546 full DEM simulations of the coefficient of pre-shear
($\mu_{psh}$). In this case the regression line is nearly linear (0.94), and
demonstrates the accurate predictive power of the $ANN$.}
