% 	Time was normalized: $\tilde{t} = t/t_{change}$, where $t_{change}$ is the
% 	point in time at which the normal stress ($\sigma_n$) was modified during the
% 	tests.
% 	Until $\tilde{t}=1$, the $\sigma_n$ was kept constant at 10,000 Pa. 
% 	In Fig. \ref{fig:20experimental}, 
%  	a plateau was reached at $\tilde{t}~=0.91$.
% 	The coefficient of pre-shear ($\mu_{psh}$) was calculated as the average of the
% 	coefficient of internal friction ($\mu_{ie}$) in this first plateau.
% 	At $\tilde{t}=1$, the $\sigma_n$ was reduced to $80 \%$ of its initial
% 	value, and soon after
% 	a second plateau developed.
% 	We obtained the coefficient of
% 	shear ($ \mu_{sh}$) as the average of $\mu_{ie}$ in this second plateau.
% 	The stress paths agree well, especially the plateaux.
% 	They were clearly relevant because
% 	the values representative of the bulk behaviours 
% 	were collected there.}
