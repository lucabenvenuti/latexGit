\caption[Method]{Method. In the training phase (dashed lines)
$DEM$ simulations are performed
with random initial input parameters.
The behaviours obtained are used to train the
Artificial Neural Networks ($ANNs$) in a loop that continues until the
difference between the outputs of each $ANN$ and its simulations is below the
limit ($\Delta$).
In the parameters identification phase (solid
lines) we identify valid input parameters by comparing (\textbf{=}) $ANNs$ and
experimental behaviours.}
