\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
\label{cap:acknowledgement}
This study was funded by the Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, Primetals
Technologies, and Voestalpine Stahl. 
The author gratefully acknowledges their financial support.\\
Further, I would like to thank my family, Daniela, Fabrizio, and Nicolo', for
the sentimental support over the last eight years of university.\\
A special thank to my supervisor Stefan Pirker, without whom this work would
have not been possible.\\
Many thanks also to Stefano Sandrone, who convinced me to start the PhD here in
Linz.
I would also like to thank Luca Flessati, who was struggling as me to
obtain a PhD, but he found the time to share some adventures with me.\\
Moreover, I feel grateful to my colleagues, especially Richard Berger, Bernhard
K\"{o}nig, Daniel Nasato, Daniel Queteschiner, Gerhard Holzinger, and Philip
H\"{o}rmandinger, for their help during these years.
I would also like to thank the employees of the Institut f\"{u}r Str\"{o}mungslehre und
W\"{a}rme\"{u}bertragung.
Many thanks also for my first supervisor Christoph Kloss, who introduced me to
the particles world.\\
I am also indebted to my friends Danilo Ansaloni and Fabio Molinari. 
Danilo not only walked me through the difficulties of advanced coding, but
especially is a good friend and always believes in me. 
Fabio not only helped me founding a job after the PhD, but he also remembered me
that I should spend less time in office and more time meeting new people.\\
A last thank to everybody, sometimes including myself, who did not believe in
me. My willingness to demonstrate I could do it in spite of you helped me to go
through many difficult times.
